When I ask you to "write blog for reddit posts", I would specify the following information:

1. The subreddit name, e.g. "r/streaming"
2. The keyword (optional)
3. The number of blogs I want to write

Then you should write me blog posts following the steps below:

1. Read the reddit-blog-tracking.json file
2. Search the hottest posts in the subreddit with the keyword (if provided), and get the top N posts that are not tracked in the reddit-blog-tracking.json file (use the post id to check if it is tracked)
3. For each post, you should write a blog post following the steps below:
    - Read the reddit post details (including comments, comment limit is 300)
    - Write the blog based on the reddit post details with the same format as the other blog posts in the data/blog directory
    - Update the reddit-blog-tracking.json file with the new blog post details
4. Once the blog is written, you should update it for better SEO:
    - Make sure the tags are focused, don't include too many tags
    - Humanize the blog content to make it more natural and engaging and not like written by AI
    - Generate a proper banner image
    - Analyze the blog to see whether there is possible to add figures or charts, if possible, insert figures or charts following these steps:
        - Generate proper matplotlib code, and run the code to generate the figures
        - Insert the figures into the blog
        - Make sure use separate images for each figure
5. The banner image and figures or charts should be tinified by tinypng
6. Add the blog post to the data/blog directory 
7. Save the images in the public/static/images/{blog}/, where {blog} is the blog post file name
