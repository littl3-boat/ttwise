When I ask you to "write blog for reddit posts", I would specify the following information:

- The subreddit name, e.g. "r/streaming"
- The keyword (optional)
- The number of blogs I want to write

Then you should write me blog posts following the steps below:

1. Read the reddit-blog-tracking.json file to understand the blog posts that have been written, remember the post ids
2. Search the hottest posts in the subreddit with the keyword (if provided), and get the top N posts that are not tracked in the reddit-blog-tracking.json file (use the post id to check if it is tracked)
3. For each post, you should write a blog post following the steps below:
    - Read the reddit post details (including comments, comment limit is 300)
    - Write the blog based on the reddit post details with the same format as the other blog posts in the data/blog directory
    - Update the reddit-blog-tracking.json file with the new blog post details
4. Once the blog is written, you should update it for better SEO:
    - Make sure the tags are focused, don't include too many tags
    - Humanize the blog content to make it more natural and engaging and not like written by AI
    - Generate a proper banner image
    - Analyze the blog to see whether there is possible to add diagrams or charts, if possible, insert diagrams or charts following these steps:
        - Generate proper mermaid code, and render to png images (use matplotlib when mermaid is not proper for this type of diagram)
        - Don't try to call MCP tools, use command line tools instead
        - Insert the figures into the blog
        - Make sure use separate images for each figure
        - Clean up the tmp files of the code
5. Compress the banner image and diagrams or charts by tinypng, and move the compressed images to the public/static/images/{blog}/ to overwrite the original images with `mv` command
6. Check the computer dates with command `date +%Y-%m-%d` and update the dates in the blog and the reddit-blog-tracking.json file

Blog structure:
- The blog post .mdx file should be saved in the data/blog directory
- All the images should be saved in the public/static/images/{blog}/, where {blog} is the blog post file name
