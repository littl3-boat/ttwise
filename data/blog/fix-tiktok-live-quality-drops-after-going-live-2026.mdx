<TLDR>
  - **核心痛点**：刚开播时画面很清晰，但几分钟后突然变模糊、出现马赛克，或者分辨率自动降到 480p 左右。
  - **搜索意图**：TikTok 直播画面突然模糊修复、直播中码率下降原因、如何保持 TikTok 直播画质稳定。
  - **关键结论**：画质中途下降通常由“编码器过载”或“网络抖动”触发的平台自适应降码引起。应通过 10 分钟排查法（编码、上传、分发三层模型）定位瓶颈；改用硬件编码（NVENC）；并设置一个低于上传上限 30% 的“保守码率”以防止触发平台的保护性降质。

## Introduction: “It Looks Fine… Until It Doesn’t”

This is one of the most frustrating TikTok Live problems because it feels like you’re doing everything right:

- Live Studio preview is clean
- OBS preview is clean
- Your first minute looks good
- Then your stream turns mushy, blocky, or “480p-ish” on phones

The reason it’s confusing is because “stream quality” isn’t one setting. It’s a chain. If any link in that chain gets unstable *after the stream starts* (network jitter, encoder spikes, platform adaptation), TikTok will protect playback by lowering quality.

## The 3-Layer Model (So You Stop Guessing)

## 10-Minute Fix Checklist (Do These in Order)

### Step 1: Confirm it’s not just one phone

- Ask a viewer on a different carrier/Wi‑Fi to confirm
- Open your Live on a second device (not on your streaming PC)
- If *some* viewers see blur and others don’t, it’s often delivery adaptation

### Step 2: Check Live Studio “Stream health” while it degrades

Look for messages like:

- network fluctuations
- unstable bitrate
- encoder overload

If you see a warning at the moment quality drops, treat it as your root cause.

### Step 3: Temporarily cap your target quality (yes, lower it on purpose)

For one test stream, set something you can hold *forever*:

- 720p60 (or 720p30 if you do face effects)
- CBR bitrate that matches your upload reality (not your best-case)

If your stream stops dropping quality at a lower target, you didn’t “fix TikTok.” You proved you were pushing above a stable ceiling.

### Step 4: Run a real upload stability test (not just a speedtest)

Speedtests show peak upload, not consistency.

- Stream for 10 minutes while nobody else uses the network
- Then stream for 10 minutes during normal household usage
- If quality drops only during shared usage, you have bufferbloat/congestion, not an OBS problem

### Step 5: Switch encoders for one session

If you’re on software encoding (x264), test hardware encoding:

- NVIDIA: NVENC
- Intel: Quick Sync
- AMD: AMF

If quality drops disappear with a hardware encoder, your CPU was spiking under real-time load (often when a game scene gets busy).

### Step 6: Reduce “hidden load” that spikes mid-stream

These are the classic “it starts fine then dies” culprits:

- browser sources (alerts, widgets, chat overlays)
- animated overlays
- replay buffers / local recording
- multi-streaming on the same PC

Disable one group at a time and retest.

## Fixes That Actually Stick (Based on What You Found)

### If Live Studio itself shows degradation (encode layer)

- drop FPS from 60 to 30 before dropping resolution
- switch to a hardware encoder
- close GPU-heavy apps (browser with lots of tabs is a common one)
- simplify overlays until stream stays clean for 30+ minutes

### If Live Studio stays clean, but phones get blurry (upload layer)

- use Ethernet (even “good Wi‑Fi” can spike)
- lower bitrate until it never triggers a warning
- avoid “max bitrate” settings that ride the edge of your upload

If your upload is inconsistent, a lower, stable bitrate looks better than a higher bitrate that keeps collapsing.

### If only some viewers see blur (TikTok delivery adaptation)

TikTok may adapt quality based on a viewer’s connection. Practical moves:

- tell viewers to tap the Live settings and set higher quality if available
- design your overlays for readability at lower quality (bigger text, thicker outlines)
- avoid tiny UI elements that become unreadable at 480p

## Quick “Safe” Settings for Most Creators

If you just want a baseline that usually holds:

- 720p
- 30 FPS (60 only if you can hold it clean)
- hardware encoder
- conservative bitrate that matches your consistent upload, not your peak

If you want more control inside TikTok Live Studio, their help center explains how auto-tests pick a starting point and why bitrate can fluctuate during a Live: https://www.tiktok.com/live/studio/help/article/Enhance-visuals/Adjust-LIVE-quality-for-smooth-and-clear-video?lang=en

## FAQ

### Why does my TikTok Live look good in OBS but bad on my phone?

OBS preview is local. Your phone is seeing the full chain: encode → upload → TikTok delivery. If the phone looks worse, the problem is usually upload stability, bitrate ceiling, or platform adaptation.

### Can TikTok lower my quality even if my bitrate is stable?

Yes. TikTok can still adapt delivery for mobile viewers, especially when the viewer’s connection is weak or fluctuating.

### Should I stream 1080p to avoid quality drops?

Only if you can hold it stable for the entire session. A clean 720p stream beats an unstable 1080p stream that keeps collapsing into blur.

### Is this an OBS issue or a TikTok Live Studio issue?

It can be either. The fastest way to tell is whether Live Studio’s own preview/stream health shows a warning at the same moment viewers see the drop.

## Conclusion

Quality drops after you go live aren’t random. They’re a signal that one of the three layers (encode, upload, delivery) can’t hold your target settings consistently. Run the 10-minute checklist once, lock in the stable baseline that never collapses, and only then scale quality upward in small steps.
