## Audio Quality Optimization Tips: Professional Sound on Any Budget

### Microphone Technique: The 6-8 Inch Rule

1. **Distance:** Keep microphone 6-8 inches from your mouth for optimal sound pickup
2. **Angle:** Speak across the microphone, not directly into it to avoid plosives
3. **Consistency:** Maintain the same distance throughout your stream for uniform audio
4. **Pop Filter:** Use a pop filter to reduce plosive sounds and improve clarity
5. **Gain Staging:** Set your microphone gain to avoid clipping while maintaining good signal level

### Room Acoustics: Transform Your Space for Better Audio

1. **Soft Surfaces:** Add rugs, curtains, and soft furniture to reduce reflections
2. **Avoid Echo:** Don't stream in empty, hard-surfaced rooms that create echo
3. **Background Noise:** Choose quiet locations away from traffic and appliances
4. **Acoustic Treatment:** Consider foam panels for better sound quality and reduced reverb
5. **Microphone Placement:** Position your mic away from walls and reflective surfaces

### Software Optimization: OBS and Audio Settings

1. **Sample Rate:** Use 48kHz for streaming (industry standard)
2. **Bit Depth:** 24-bit for recording, 16-bit for streaming to balance quality and bandwidth
3. **Buffer Size:** Lower for less latency, higher for stability (start with 512 samples)
4. **CPU Usage:** Monitor and optimize for smooth streaming without audio dropouts
5. **Audio Filters:** Use OBS noise suppression, gain, and compression filters for professional sound
