## Introduction

*"I can stream to Twitch at 6000 Kbps with 0 dropped frames. But the moment I start my TikTok stream key, OBS hits 20-30 percent dropped frames. My internet is fine. What gives?"*

This is a classic thread on r/OBS. You run a speed test, and it says 500 Mbps upload. You stream to YouTube or Twitch, and it’s buttery smooth. But TikTok Live? It’s a stuttering mess of dropped packets.

The confusion comes from treating all streaming platforms the same. They aren't. Twitch has a massive, mature global infrastructure designed to swallow whatever bitrate you throw at it. TikTok's RTMP ingest servers are newer, stricter, and more prone to rejecting "spiky" data.

If you are seeing the **"Network Dropped Frames"** counter go up in OBS (the red box), this guide is for you.

## The Diagnosis: Dropped vs. Skipped vs. Missed

Before we fix it, confirm you are actually having a *network* problem. OBS has three error types:

1.  **Rendering Lag (Missed Frames)**: Your GPU is overloaded.
2.  **Encoding Lag (Skipped Frames)**: Your CPU/Encoder is overloaded.
3.  **Network Dropped Frames (Red Square)**: Your internet cannot talk to the server fast enough.

If your log says **"Number of Dropped Frames due to Insufficient Bandwidth/Network"**, proceed below. If it says "Encoding Lag", you need to lower your resolution or preset, not your network settings.

## Why TikTok Drops Frames When Twitch Doesn't

### 1. The "Auto" Server Trap
On Twitch, "Auto" server selection usually works perfectly. On TikTok (especially if you are using a "Custom RTMP" setup in OBS), you might be forcing a connection to a generic URL (like `rtmp://push-rtmp-l11-us01.tiktokcdn.com`) that isn't geographically closest to you.

### 2. Strict CBR (Constant Bitrate) Rejection
Twitch is lenient. If you set 6000 Kbps and your encoder spikes to 8000 Kbps for a second during an explosion, Twitch handles it. TikTok's servers often "choke" on these spikes, dropping the packets entirely to maintain sync.

### 3. The "Double Upload" Bottleneck
If you are multistreaming (sending one stream to Twitch and one to TikTok via a plugin), you are using **double the upload bandwidth**. A 6000 Kbps Twitch stream + 4000 Kbps TikTok stream = 10 Mbps sustained upload. If your ISP has jitter, one of them will fail—and it's usually the one with the stricter handshake (TikTok).

## Step-by-Step Fixes

### Fix 1: Manually Select Your Ingest Server
If you are using a plugin like Aitum Vertical or a Custom RTMP dock:
1.  Do not just copy the first URL you see.
2.  If TikTok gives you multiple server options, ping them (in CMD: `ping <server-url-without-rtmp://>`) to see which has the lowest latency.
3.  **Use the specific regional URL** if available, rather than the global "push-rtmp" address.

### Fix 2: Enable "Dynamic Bitrate" (The Magic Switch)
OBS has a feature designed exactly for this instability.
1.  Go to **Settings > Advanced**.
2.  Scroll to **Network**.
3.  Check **"Dynamically change bitrate to manage congestion"**.
4.  **Uncheck** "Enable network optimizations" (sometimes this conflicts with TikTok).

**What this does:** Instead of dropping frames (freezing the video), OBS will slightly lower your quality for a few seconds until the connection stabilizes. It is much better for the viewer experience than a frozen screen.

### Fix 3: Enforce Strict CBR at 3500-4000 Kbps
TikTok does not need 6000 Kbps. In fact, high bitrates often cause mobile buffering.
1.  Go to **Settings > Output**.
2.  Set Rate Control to **CBR**.
3.  Set Bitrate to **3500 Kbps** (or 4000 max).
4.  Set **Keyframe Interval** to **2s** (Crucial! TikTok hates 0 or Auto).
5.  Set **Profile** to **Main**.

### Fix 4: Check Your MTU (Advanced)
If you are on a specific ISP (like some fiber providers), standard packet sizes (MTU 1500) might be fragmenting.
*   *Note: Only try this if Fix 1-3 fail.*
*   Try lowering your MTU to 1400 in your router settings or Windows adapter settings. This often solves mysterious packet loss on RTMP streams.

## Practical Conclusion

If you are dropping frames on TikTok Live but not Twitch, stop blaming your ISP speed test. The issue is the **stability of the path** to TikTok's ingest server. Lower your bitrate to 3500, lock your Keyframe Interval to 2 seconds, and turn on Dynamic Bitrate in OBS. Your mobile viewers (watching on small screens) won't notice the bitrate drop, but they *will* notice a stream that doesn't freeze every 10 seconds.
