## Why Does OBS "Lie" to You?

Many creators experience a strange phenomenon while streaming: the status square in the bottom right of OBS is green, and the preview is buttery smooth, but opening the stream on a phone looks like a slideshow. This usually happens because the **Rendering Process** and the **Encoding/Streaming Process** have become disconnected.

### Core Logic Visualization: Where is the Bottleneck?

### 1. The "Illusion" of Network Upload Bandwidth
Even if your fiber connection claims 100Mbps upload, network jitter is fatal for "continuous high-intensity" tasks like live streaming.

- **Solution**:
    - Enable "Dynamic Bitrate" in OBS.
    - Set Rate Control to CBR (Constant Bitrate); do not use VBR.

## Step 1: Find Where the Lag is Actually Happening

Before adjusting settings, I usually perform two quick checks:

1.  **Check OBS Stats Panel**: `View` -> `Stats`
2.  **Check Mobile Feedback**: Watch the stream on a phone using mobile data for 30-60 seconds.

You need to distinguish between these three scenarios:
- **Rendering Lag**: Your PC can't draw the frames (OBS Stats show increased Rendering Lag).
- **Encoding Lag**: Encoder is overloaded (OBS Stats show increased Encoding Lag).
- **Network/Streaming Issues**: TikTok reception is unstable (OBS Stats show Network Dropped Frames, or OBS looks normal but the phone stream lags).

## Step 2: Align with TikTok's Core Parameters

TikTok has a much lower tolerance for parameter variations than Twitch or YouTube.

### 1) FPS Matching
If you set 60 FPS but your network cannot maintain it, TikTok will look very laggy. It is recommended to start with **30 FPS** and only move to 60 once stability is confirmed.

### 2) Lock Keyframe Interval to 2 Seconds
This is a hard requirement for TikTok to function correctly. In `Settings` -> `Output` -> `Streaming`, set `Keyframe Interval` to `2`.

### 3) Bitrate Control
- **720p @ 30 FPS**: `2500–3500 Kbps`
- **1080p @ 30 FPS**: `3500–5500 Kbps`

## Step 3: Avoid Double Encoding

If you are running both OBS and TikTok Live Studio and capturing the scene via Virtual Camera, it can lead to CPU/GPU overload even if the preview looks fine.

**Optimal Paths**:
- **Option A (Recommended)**: Stream directly from OBS using a Stream Key.
- **Option B**: If you must use TikTok Live Studio, keep the OBS load to a minimum and avoid high-bitrate local recording during the stream.

## Step 4: Fix “Looks Fine Locally” Network Problems

Viewer-only lag usually means TikTok isn’t getting a clean, steady upload. Three practical fixes that matter more than people expect:

### 1) Switch to wired

Wi‑Fi can look “fast” but still have micro dropouts that TikTok punishes.

### 2) Leave upload headroom

If your upload is 8 Mbps and you stream 6 Mbps, you’re gambling.

A simple rule I use:

- Keep stream bitrate at **≤ 50–60%** of your tested upload

### 3) Stop background uploaders

Cloud sync, game launchers, browser tabs, Discord streaming—kill anything that can spike upload.

## Step 5: Use a Short Test Loop (Don’t Tweak Blind)

I like a repeatable 5-minute loop:

1. Go live unlisted/private (or to a test account)
2. Watch `View` → `Stats` for 2 minutes
3. Watch a phone feed for 30 seconds (preferably LTE)
4. Change **one** setting (FPS, bitrate, encoder preset, keyframes)
5. Repeat

If you change five things at once, you’ll “fix it” and have no clue why (and you won’t be able to reproduce the fix later).

</div>

**Diagram explanation**: This flowchart forces a simple order: confirm whether the bottleneck is **rendering/encoding**, **upload stability**, or **double-encoding**. Each branch ends in the same thing: a short test loop so you can verify changes instead of trusting a smooth local preview.

## Actionable Checklist (Copy/Paste Before You Go Live)

- [ ] `Keyframe Interval` = `2`
- [ ] `CBR` enabled (for troubleshooting)
- [ ] Start at `720x1280 @ 30 FPS` to find a stable baseline
- [ ] Bitrate set with headroom (≤ 60% of real upload)
- [ ] Wired ethernet (or at least test it once)
- [ ] No heavy recording while troubleshooting
- [ ] Watch `View` → `Stats` during a real stream
- [ ] Verify on a phone feed, not just OBS Preview

## FAQ

### Why is OBS Preview smooth if viewers see lag?

OBS Preview is your **local render**. Viewers see the result after **encoding + upload + TikTok ingest + mobile playback**. Any one of those steps can be the bottleneck.

### What settings usually fix TikTok Live lag fastest?

In practice: `30 FPS`, `keyframes=2`, `CBR`, and a bitrate that leaves upload headroom. Then eliminate double-encoding if you’re routing through TikTok Live Studio.

### Can TikTok force 30 FPS even if I stream 60?

Yes. If TikTok can’t ingest your stream cleanly, it can degrade playback (including frame cadence) without making it obvious in your OBS preview.

### Should I use x264 or NVENC/Quick Sync?

If you have a decent GPU, hardware encoding is usually more stable for TikTok Live because it reduces CPU spikes (which show up as micro-stutter on the viewer end).

## Practical Conclusion

When OBS looks perfect but TikTok Live lags, the fix is rarely “turn everything up.” Treat it like a pipeline problem: lock in a stable baseline, match the settings TikTok expects (FPS, keyframes, bitrate), avoid double-encoding, and test on a real viewer feed.

Once it’s smooth at 720p30, then you can earn your way back to 1080p or 60 FPS without gambling your stream.
