Under this diagram: Follow this flow to build habits that prevent burnout – start with awareness and end with balanced streaming.

1. Lock in a Realistic Schedule: Limit yourself to short bursts – think 2-3 hours, a few days a week. It leaves room for life.

2. Schedule Those Breaks: Use an app or alarm to step away briefly. A quick walk or snack can reset your energy.

3. Mix It Up: Gaming all the time? Add interactive segments like polls or casual chats to keep things fun and less repetitive.

4. Focus on You: Don't skip workouts, good sleep, or non-streaming fun. These recharge your batteries.

5. Build Your Support Squad: Chat with other streamers online; sharing experiences can lighten the load.
