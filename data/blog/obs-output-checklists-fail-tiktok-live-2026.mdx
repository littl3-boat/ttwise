## Introduction (Reddit-native context)

r/OBS is full of “post your settings” threads. The same checklist repeats: CBR, 2s keyframes, 720p30. You apply it and still get a soft, stuttery TikTok Live.

This is why creators say “checklists don’t work.” The checklist isn’t wrong. It’s incomplete. It controls what OBS can control, but the failure is often in **everything after OBS**.

## Why Output Checklists Fail

Checklist settings are necessary. They are not sufficient. TikTok Live quality depends on three hidden layers:

1. **Ingest path (how you get to TikTok)**  
   Stream key vs Live Studio vs Virtual Camera can add silent scaling or re-encoding.

2. **Upload headroom (what your network can really sustain)**  
   A 10 Mbps speed test does not mean a stable 10 Mbps for two hours.

3. **Phone playback (the only truth)**  
   OBS preview can look clean while TikTok looks soft due to mobile re-encode and adaptive delivery.

  <p className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Instead of memorizing settings, measure symptoms and map them to causes. That is how you fix TikTok Live quality.</p>
</div>

### Symptom: Soft image on phone
- **Cause:** Upload headroom too low or TikTok re-encoding aggressive
- **Fix:** Lower bitrate, confirm stable upload, test on cellular

### Symptom: Audio feels late
- **Cause:** Mixed sample rates or buffering
- **Fix:** Match everything to 48 kHz, avoid resampling

### Symptom: Random stutter
- **Cause:** Rendering/encoding overload
- **Fix:** Cap game FPS, simplify scenes, reduce encoder preset

## The Anti-Checklist: What actually works

Instead of blind settings, use a short diagnostic loop:

1. **Pick a conservative baseline** (720p30, CBR, 2s keyframes)
2. **Stream for 10 minutes**
3. **Check OBS Stats for dropped/encoding/rendering lag**
4. **Watch on a phone over cellular**
5. **Change only one variable**

If you pass all five steps and it still looks soft, the issue is almost always **ingest path** (Live Studio capture caps or re-encode).

## Actionable Checklist (Diagnostic Edition)

- [ ] Confirm ingest path (stream key vs Live Studio)
- [ ] Watch OBS Stats for 10 minutes
- [ ] Phone test on cellular, not Wi‑Fi
- [ ] Match audio sample rate to 48 kHz
- [ ] Change one variable at a time

## FAQ

**Q: Why does the same checklist work on Twitch but not TikTok Live?**  
A: TikTok’s ingest and mobile re-encode are less forgiving. Twitch tolerates spikes that TikTok will crush.

**Q: Should I still use checklists?**  
A: Yes, as a baseline. Just don’t assume it guarantees quality.

**Q: What’s the most common “hidden” failure?**  
A: Upload headroom. Most home connections spike or drop after 20–30 minutes, which TikTok penalizes.

## Practical Conclusion

OBS checklists are guardrails, not solutions. TikTok Live quality fails when the bottleneck is outside OBS. Measure the ingest path, test on phone, and treat symptoms instead of repeating the same checklist expecting a different result.
