## Introduction

You’ve spent hours perfecting your OBS settings.

## Why Standard "Sync" Logic Fails on TikTok

When you stream to Twitch, OBS packages the video and audio into a single stream. But on TikTok, many creators use the OBS Virtual Camera to send video to TikTok Live Studio while sending audio through a separate virtual audio cable. This creates two independent paths with different latencies.

</div>

**This diagram shows:**
Your video must be rendered by OBS, sent to the Virtual Camera driver, and then "captured" by TikTok. This adds roughly 150ms–300ms of delay. Your audio, however, travels almost instantaneously. This is why the audio always feels "fast" or the video feels "slow."

## Sync Checklist

If you are experiencing this offset, follow these steps in order.

### Step 1: Match Your Sample Rates
The most common cause of "drifting" desync (which gets worse over time) is a sample rate mismatch.
- [ ] Open Windows Sound Settings (Control Panel).
- [ ] Ensure your microphone, speakers, and virtual audio cables are all set to **48000Hz**.
- [ ] Open OBS Settings → Audio and ensure it is also set to **48kHz**.

### Step 2: Calculate the Delay
Don't guess. Use the "Clap Test."
1. Start your TikTok stream (or use the local recording feature in TikTok Live Studio).
2. Clap once in front of the camera.
3. Watch the playback. If the sound happens *before* your hands touch, the audio is leading.
4. Estimate the gap (usually between 200ms and 400ms).

### Step 3: Apply the OBS Offset
Since the video is slower, we must slow down the audio to match.
1. In OBS, look at the **Mixer**.
2. Click the three dots (gear icon) and select **Advanced Audio Properties**.
3. Locate the **Sync Offset (ms)** column.
4. Enter a positive value (e.g., `250`) for your microphone and desktop audio.
   *   *Note: Start at 200ms and fine-tune in 50ms increments.*

  />
  <p className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">OBS Advanced Audio Properties Sync Offset: Enter the sync offset here to delay audio and match the video path.</p>
</div>

### Step 4: Create a "TikTok Only" Profile
Since this offset will break your sync on Twitch or YouTube, you should create a separate **Profile** in OBS.
1. Go to the top menu: **Profile → New**.
2. Name it "TikTok Live."
3. Apply your sync offset here. Switch back to your "Twitch" profile when you aren't streaming on TikTok.

## Decision Guide: Virtual Camera vs. Stream Key

| Setup Method | Desync Risk | Sync Complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Virtual Camera + Virtual Cable** | **High** | Requires manual offset (200ms-500ms). |
| **RTMP Stream Key (Direct)** | **Low** | Usually stays in sync automatically. |
| **TikTok Live Studio (Native)** | **None" | No OBS needed, but limited features. |

## FAQ: Solving Weird Edge Cases

**"My audio starts synced but starts drifting after an hour. Why?"**
This is almost always a CPU thermal throttling issue or a sample rate mismatch (see Step 1). If your CPU hits 100%, it will prioritize video frames and "drop" audio timing data.

**"Do I need a virtual audio cable (VB-CABLE)?"**
Yes. If you use the OBS Virtual Camera, you *must* use a virtual cable to bring OBS's audio into TikTok Live Studio. Otherwise, you might just be selecting the raw mic in TikTok, which bypasses all your OBS filters and sync settings.

**"Can I fix this in TikTok Live Studio instead of OBS?"**
TikTok Live Studio has a "delay" setting for audio inputs, but it’s less precise than OBS. It's better to fix it at the source (OBS Advanced Audio Properties).

## Summary

"TikTok Desync" isn't an OBS bug—it's a byproduct of using two different software layers to handle one stream. By acknowledging the Virtual Camera's processing delay and applying a **200ms–300ms positive offset**, you can achieve that professional, locked-in look and avoid losing viewers.
