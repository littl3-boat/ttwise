You’ve spent hours perfecting your OBS settings. Your local recordings are crisp. Your Twitch stream is perfectly synced. But then you go live on TikTok, and your viewers start commenting: *"Your mouth is moving but the sound comes a second later."*

This specific "TikTok-only" audio desync is a nightmare for r/OBS users because it defies standard logic. If it's fine everywhere else, why is TikTok different?

The answer usually lies in how TikTok Live Studio (or the app) handles the **Virtual Camera** feed versus how it handles audio inputs.

## TL;DR
The desync happens because TikTok Live Studio processes the OBS Virtual Camera (video) slower than it processes your Microphone (audio). To fix it, you need to apply a **Sync Offset** in OBS Advanced Audio Properties specifically for your TikTok sessions.

## Why Standard 'Sync' Logic Fails on TikTok

When you stream to Twitch, OBS bundles video and audio together into a single stream. On TikTok, many creators use OBS Virtual Camera to send video to TikTok Live Studio while sending audio through a separate Virtual Cable. This creates two independent paths with different latency.

**What this diagram shows:**
Your video has to be rendered by OBS, sent to a Virtual Camera driver, and then "captured" by TikTok. This adds roughly 150ms–300ms of delay. Your audio, however, travels almost instantly. This is why the audio always feels "early" or the video feels "late."

## The Step-by-Step Sync Checklist

If you are experiencing this drift, follow these steps in order.

### Step 1: Match Your Sample Rates
The most common cause of *drifting* desync (where it gets worse over time) is a sample rate mismatch.
- [ ] Open Windows Sound Settings (Control Panel).
- [ ] Ensure your Mic, Speakers, and Virtual Cable are all set to **48000Hz**.
- [ ] Open OBS Settings → Audio and ensure it is also set to **48kHz**.

### Step 2: Calculate the Delay
Don't guess the numbers. Use the "Clap Test."
1. Start your TikTok Live (or use a local recording in TikTok Live Studio).
2. Record yourself clapping once.
3. Watch the playback. If the sound happens *before* your hands touch, your audio is early.
4. Estimate the gap. (Usually, it's between 200ms and 400ms).

### Step 3: Apply the OBS Offset
Since the video is slow, we must slow down the audio to match it.
1. In OBS, look at the **Audio Mixer**.
2. Click the three dots (cogwheel) and select **Advanced Audio Properties**.
3. Find your "Sync Offset (ms)" column.
4. For your Microphone and Desktop Audio, enter a positive value (e.g., `250`).
   *   *Note: Start with 200ms and adjust in 50ms increments.*

### Step 4: The 'TikTok-Specific' Profile
Because this offset will ruin your Twitch or YouTube sync, you should create a separate **Profile** in OBS.
1. Go to the top menu: **Profile → New**.
2. Name it "TikTok Live."
3. Apply your sync offsets here. Switch back to your "Twitch" profile when you aren't on TikTok.

## Decision Guide: Virtual Camera vs. Stream Key

| Setup Method | Desync Risk | Sync Complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Virtual Camera + Virtual Cable** | **High** | Requires manual offset (200ms-500ms). |
| **RTMP Stream Key (Direct)** | **Low** | Usually stays in sync automatically. |
| **TikTok Live Studio (Native)** | **Zero** | No OBS needed, but limited features. |

## FAQ: Solving the Weird Edge Cases

**"My audio is in sync at first but drifts after an hour. Why?"**
This is almost always a CPU thermal throttling issue or a sample rate mismatch (Step 1). If your CPU hits 100%, it will prioritize video frames and "drop" audio timing data.

**"Do I need a Virtual Audio Cable (VB-CABLE)?"**
Yes. If you use OBS Virtual Camera, you *must* use a Virtual Audio Cable to get your OBS audio into TikTok Live Studio. Without it, you are likely just selecting your Raw Mic in TikTok, which bypasses all your OBS filters and sync settings.

**"Can I fix this in TikTok Live Studio instead of OBS?"**
TikTok Live Studio has a "Delay" setting for audio inputs, but it is less precise than OBS. It is better to "fix it at the source" in OBS Advanced Audio Properties.

## Conclusion

The "TikTok Desync" isn't a bug in OBS; it's a byproduct of using two different software layers to handle one stream. By acknowledging the processing delay of the Virtual Camera and applying a **200ms–300ms positive offset** to your audio, you can achieve that professional, locked-in feel that keeps viewers from clicking away.
