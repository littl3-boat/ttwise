<TLDR>
  - **核心痛点**：恐怖游戏直播容易陷入两个极端：要么脚本化太强导致观众觉得假，要么节奏太慢导致观众流失。
  - **搜索意图**：适合直播的恐怖游戏推荐，以及如何保持恐怖直播的互动性。
  - **关键结论**：选择能产生“共同恐惧体验”的游戏。对于高能反应型主播，推荐《Outlast》或 Chilla's Art 系列（节奏快、惊吓点明确）；对于氛围叙事型主播，推荐《Visage》或《寂静岭 2》（慢热但后劲足）。关键在于建立直播间的“恐惧契约”：规定什么时候禁言、设置心率监测或弹幕投票，让观众成为恐惧的一部分，而不仅仅是旁观者。

- Outlast (I & II): unapologetically scripted, brutally effective for startle + chase.
- Visage: the spiritual successor to PT’s tension—slow dread done right.
- Luto: like Visage’s older, meaner sibling—great for long, silent holds.
- Chilla’s Art (e.g., Night Security): dozens of short, unnerving shifts; good for variety nights.
- The Suffering (classic): dated visuals, still creepy—works as a retro fright night.
- Silent Hill 2 (Remake): melancholy dread over cheap jumps; deliver it with roleplay.
- Jisatsu: smaller‑scope psychological fear—great for one‑sitting streams.

Tip: pair slow‑burn games with “breather” segments (clips/polls) between story beats. Pace is a feature, not a bug.

## How to Stream Horror Without Losing Momentum

- Prime your audience: “No backseating unless I ask. If I say ‘lights out,’ we go quiet.” Rituals build tension.
- Keep a fear meter on screen: 1–5 emoji slider; let chat vote after big moments.
- Use short redeems during lulls: heart‑rate check, 10‑sec no‑talk, lights to red.
- Checkpoints for new joiners: quick, spoiler‑light recap every 20–30 minutes.

## Diagram: Pick the Right Horror Game for Your Stream

### Diagram explanation

1) Start with your persona: high‑energy react streamer vs. calm storyteller.  
2) If you thrive on chases/jumps, pick Outlast or a Chilla’s Art short—fast chat cycles.  
3) If you prefer slow dread, pick Visage/Luto/Silent Hill 2—announce quiet rules so silence feels intentional.  
4) Need retro vibes? Slot The Suffering as a themed night; lean into camp + commentary.  
5) Mix 1 long arc + 1 short one‑shot per week to keep variety without whiplash.

## Suggested Program (2 Weeks)

- Week 1: Visage (2 sessions) + Chilla’s Art one‑shot.  
- Week 2: Outlast II finale + viewer‑voted indie pick.

Close with a highlights reel; title the VOD around the biggest scare, not the game.
