## TL;DR
If TikTok Live Studio freezes or drops to **0 kbps upload** after 1–2 hours, it’s usually a conflict between **Administrator privileges** and **Windows Power Saving** settings. Run as Admin and disable "Allow the computer to turn off this device" for your network adapter.

## The "Silent Freeze" Nightmare

It’s the worst kind of crash because it doesn’t happen immediately.

You start your stream, everything feels smooth. Your game is running at 144FPS, chat is active, and the preview looks crisp. But exactly **60 to 90 minutes in**, it happens:

- The preview freezes.
- Your upload speed (bitrate) drops to **0 kbps** and stays there.
- Chat stops updating.
- You have to Force Close the app via Task Manager just to restart.

A streamer on Reddit described it perfectly:
> "My TikTok studio runs fine but after an hour or two I notice buffering... TikTok studio has literally stopped uploading... it sticks on (0)."

This isn't just "lag." This is a software hang that kills your momentum and viewer retention instantly. If you’re tired of restarting your stream halfway through a raid, follow this checklist.

## Step 1: The "Run as Administrator" Rule (Do Not Skip)

TikTok Live Studio is heavier than OBS in how it hooks into your system resources, especially for game capture. If Windows de-prioritizes it, the upload thread can hang.

**The Fix:**
1. Right-click the **TikTok Live Studio** shortcut.
2. Select **Properties** > **Compatibility**.
3. Check **Run this program as an administrator**.
4. Click **Apply**.

*Why this matters:* It gives the software permission to override background processes that might otherwise "pause" the upload connection during high CPU usage.

## Step 2: Disable Network Adapter Power Saving

This is the hidden culprit for 80% of "drop to 0 kbps" issues. Windows tries to save power by putting your Ethernet or Wi-Fi card to "sleep" during micro-idle moments, which kills the RTMP connection.

**The Fix:**
1. Press `Win + X` and select **Device Manager**.
2. Expand **Network adapters**.
3. Right-click your main adapter (e.g., "Realtek Gaming GbE Family Controller") and hit **Properties**.
4. Go to the **Power Management** tab.
5. **Uncheck**: "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power."

## Step 3: Cap Your Bitrate (Don't Trust "Auto")

TikTok Live Studio's "Auto" or "Dynamic" bitrate feature is aggressive. It tries to push 8000+ kbps even if your connection jitters, causing the encoder to choke and freeze.

**The Setting:**
- Go to **Settings** > **Stream Settings**.
- **Video Bitrate:** Set to **CBR** (Constant Bitrate).
- **Target:** **4000 kbps** to **6000 kbps** (do not exceed 6000 unless you are a Partner).
- **fps:** Cap at **60fps** (or 30fps if you are on a single PC setup).

## Step 4: Visual C++ Redistributables

TikTok Live Studio relies heavily on Microsoft Visual C++ libraries. If these are outdated or corrupted, the rendering engine will freeze while the UI remains responsive.

**The Check:**
1. Search "Add or remove programs" in Windows.
2. Search for "Visual C++".
3. If you don't see **2015-2022 Redistributable**, download the latest `vc_redist.x64.exe` from Microsoft’s official site.

## Troubleshooting Checklist

If you still crash mid-stream, run through this quick audit before going live:

- [ ] **Administrator Mode:** Is the shield icon visible on launch?
- [ ] **Background Apps:** Are Chrome/Spotify hardware acceleration disabled?
- [ ] **Overlay Check:** Have you removed web sources that might be leaking memory (e.g., complex browser sources)?
- [ ] **Encoder:** Are you using **NVIDIA NVENC H.264** instead of x264? (CPU encoding often freezes dual-setups).

## FAQ

**Q: Why does it only happen after 1 hour?**
A: This points to a **memory leak** or **thermal throttling**. If your GPU hits 85°C+, it downclocks, causing the encoder to stall. Check your temps with HWMonitor.

**Q: Can I just use OBS instead?**
A: Yes, and for many, it’s more stable. You can use the "Stream Key" method (if you have access) to stream to TikTok via OBS, which avoids Live Studio's bugs entirely.

**Q: Does reinstalling fix it?**
A: Rarely. The issue is usually *settings* or *permissions*, not corrupted files. However, clearing the cache inside TikTok Live Studio settings can help.

## Verdict

You shouldn't have to restart your stream every hour. The "0 kbps freeze" is almost always a **power-saving** or **permission** conflict, not your internet connection.

Start with **Step 2 (Network Power Saving)**—it’s the most common fix that nobody talks about. Once stable, you can push your bitrate back up. Keep creating.
