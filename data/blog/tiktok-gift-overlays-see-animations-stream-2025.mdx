*Gift animations are TikTok's engagement currency—make sure they show up on your stream so viewers know their gifts are being seen.*

> Source discussion: How do you see gifts on TikTok? — r/streaming. Core problem: TikTok gift animations show on viewers' phones but not in the streamer's overlay, making it hard to react to gifts and confusing viewers about what's actually visible.

---

## The TikTok Gift Visibility Problem

When viewers send gifts on TikTok Live, two things happen:

1. **Viewers see animated gift effects** on their phone screens
2. **You see gift notifications** in the activity feed (text only)

The problem? Those animated gift effects don't automatically appear in your stream overlay. So:

- **Viewers expect** to see gift animations on stream (like Twitch bits or YouTube superchats)
- **You only see** text notifications in the activity feed
- **Your stream** shows no visual reaction to gifts
- **Viewers think** you're ignoring their gifts

This creates a disconnect: viewers are sending gifts expecting visual feedback, but your stream doesn't show what they're seeing on their phones.

---

## Why TikTok Gifts Work Differently

TikTok's gift system is fundamentally different from Twitch or YouTube:

- **Gifts are visual animations** that play on the viewer's device
- **No native overlay system** to show gifts in your stream
- **Activity feed shows text** but not the animated effects
- **No built-in way** to capture gift animations for streaming

Unlike Twitch (where bits show as animated overlays) or YouTube (where superchats appear as on-screen alerts), TikTok gifts are viewer-side effects that don't automatically translate to stream overlays.

This is why r/streaming users ask: *"How do TikTok streamers know what's actually being seen by their viewers?"*

## Solution 1: Use TikFinity for Gift Overlays

![Gift Overlay Flow](/static/images/tiktok-gift-overlays-see-animations-stream-2025/gift-overlay-flow.png)

*This sequence diagram shows the complete gift flow from viewer to streamer, highlighting the three different views: what viewers see, what the overlay shows, and what the streamer experiences.*

The diagram above illustrates the gift overlay workflow. When a viewer sends a gift, TikTok shows its native animation on the viewer's device, while TikFinity/Tiktory captures the event data and triggers a custom alert in your OBS overlay. This creates a synchronized experience where viewers see TikTok's animations and your stream shows custom gift alerts.

TikFinity is the most popular solution for showing TikTok gifts on stream:

1. **Sign up at TikFinity** and connect your TikTok account
2. **Enable gift alerts** in TikFinity settings
3. **Customize gift overlay styles** (animations, sounds, positioning)
4. **Add TikFinity browser source** to OBS or TikTok Live Studio
5. **Configure gift triggers** to show alerts when gifts are sent

**TikFinity gift features:**
- Real-time gift detection
- Customizable gift alert animations
- Sound effects for different gift types
- Gift counter and goal widgets
- Recent gifters display

**Setup steps:**
- Create TikFinity account and link TikTok
- Go to "Alerts" section and enable "Gift Alerts"
- Customize alert style (position, animation, duration)
- Copy browser source URL from TikFinity
- Add as browser source in OBS (refresh browser cache: false, width: 1920, height: 1080)
- Test by sending a gift from another account

## Solution 2: Use Tiktory for Gift Notifications

Tiktory offers similar gift overlay functionality:

1. **Create Tiktory account** and connect TikTok
2. **Set up gift widgets** in Tiktory dashboard
3. **Configure gift alert styles** and triggers
4. **Add Tiktory browser source** to OBS
5. **Position gift overlay** where viewers can see it

**Tiktory advantages:**
- Cleaner interface than TikFinity
- More customization options
- Better performance for some users
- Integrated with other TikTok events

**Tiktory setup:**
- Link TikTok account in Tiktory
- Navigate to "Widgets" → "Gift Alerts"
- Customize alert appearance and behavior
- Add browser source URL to OBS
- Test gift alerts with a test account

## Solution 3: Monitor Activity Feed + Manual Reactions

If you can't use TikFinity or Tiktory, you can manually monitor gifts:

1. **Keep TikTok activity feed open** on a second monitor or phone
2. **Watch for gift notifications** in the feed
3. **React verbally** when you see gifts
4. **Use OBS text sources** to manually display gift information

**Manual approach:**
- Open TikTok Live on your phone or second screen
- Watch the activity feed for gift notifications
- When a gift appears, react on stream
- Optionally add a text overlay showing recent gifts (manually updated)

**Limitations:**
- No automatic overlay animations
- Requires constant monitoring
- Easy to miss gifts during intense gameplay
- Less engaging than automated alerts

This works as a temporary solution but isn't ideal for long-term streaming.

## Solution 4: Use OBS Browser Source with Custom HTML

For advanced users, you can create custom gift overlays:

1. **Use TikTok's API** (if available) or web scraping to detect gifts
2. **Create custom HTML/CSS/JavaScript** overlay
3. **Add as browser source** in OBS
4. **Style gift alerts** to match your brand

**Custom overlay benefits:**
- Complete control over appearance
- No dependency on third-party services
- Can combine with other event types
- Fully customizable animations

**Custom overlay challenges:**
- Requires programming knowledge
- TikTok API access may be limited
- More maintenance than ready-made solutions
- Potential rate limiting issues

This approach is best for streamers with technical skills who want full control.

## Best Practice: Combine Multiple Methods

The most reliable approach is to layer multiple gift detection methods:

1. **Primary: TikFinity or Tiktory** for automatic gift overlays
2. **Backup: Activity feed monitoring** on phone or second screen
3. **Visual: Gift counter widget** showing total gifts received
4. **Audio: Gift sound alerts** so you hear gifts even if you miss visual alerts

**OBS setup:**
- Add TikFinity browser source for gift alerts
- Position gift overlay in visible area (not covered by chat)
- Add gift counter widget (also from TikFinity)
- Configure gift sound alerts in TikFinity
- Keep phone with TikTok Live open as backup monitor

This gives you:
- Automatic gift detection and display
- Backup monitoring if alerts fail
- Visual feedback for viewers
- Audio cues so you never miss a gift

## Positioning Gift Overlays Correctly

Gift overlays need to be visible but not intrusive:

**Good positions:**
- **Top-center** or **top-right** (away from chat)
- **Above gameplay** but below webcam (if you have one)
- **Corner placement** with transparency for non-intrusive display

**Avoid:**
- **Bottom of screen** (where chat appears)
- **Center of gameplay** (blocks important action)
- **Over webcam** (hides your face)

**TikTok-specific considerations:**
- TikTok's UI places chat on the right side
- Gift carousel appears at bottom
- Leave space for TikTok's native UI elements
- Test overlay on phone to see final result

## Troubleshooting Gift Overlays

Common issues and fixes:

**Gifts not showing in overlay:**
- Check TikFinity/Tiktory account connection
- Verify TikTok account is linked correctly
- Refresh browser source in OBS
- Check gift alert settings are enabled

**Gift alerts delayed:**
- TikFinity server issues (common on free tier)
- Internet connection problems
- Browser source refresh rate too low
- OBS performance bottlenecks

**Gift animations not matching viewer experience:**
- TikTok's native animations are viewer-side only
- Your overlay shows custom animations (from TikFinity/Tiktory)
- This is normal—viewers see TikTok's animations, you show custom overlays
- Consider explaining this to viewers so they understand

**Gift counter not updating:**
- Refresh browser source
- Check TikFinity/Tiktory dashboard for gift data
- Verify account permissions
- Clear browser cache

## Understanding What Viewers See

It's important to understand the difference between:

- **What viewers see on their phones**: TikTok's native gift animations
- **What appears in your stream overlay**: Custom gift alerts from TikFinity/Tiktory
- **What you see in activity feed**: Text notifications

These are three different things, and they don't always match. Your overlay is a representation of gifts, not the exact same animation viewers see.

**Best practice:** Acknowledge gifts verbally on stream, even if your overlay shows them. This ensures viewers know you're seeing and appreciating their gifts.

---

## Final Take

TikTok gift overlays require third-party tools because TikTok doesn't provide native overlay support. TikFinity and Tiktory are the most reliable solutions, but they require setup and may have limitations.

The key is to:
- Set up automated gift detection (TikFinity or Tiktory)
- Position overlays where viewers can see them
- Monitor activity feed as backup
- React to gifts verbally on stream

Don't let TikTok's lack of native overlay support stop you from engaging with gift senders. With the right tools, you can give viewers the gift recognition they expect—and deserve.
