## The 30-Minute Wall (Problem)

If your stream dies at roughly the same time every session, that consistency is the clue. Random bugs don’t keep a schedule, but thermal protection, power limits, driver watchdogs, and network lease hiccups often do.

One r/TikTokLive creator put it plainly: “My live crashes at about 30 minutes every time. No error, just gone.” That’s the classic pattern.

## Why 30 Minutes Is a Clue (Cause Buckets)

### Bucket 1: Heat or Power Throttle

If your device is hot to the touch, fans are spiking, or the case feels warm near the GPU/CPU, your system may be throttling itself to survive. That protection often kicks in around a predictable time window.

Signs:
- The PC or laptop feels unusually hot
- Performance slowly degrades before the crash
- You recover only after a full restart or cool-down

Fixes:
- Lower output resolution or FPS for TikTok Live
- Cap in-game FPS to reduce heat
- Clean dust and open airflow paths
- Use a slower charger if streaming on mobile

### Bucket 2: Encoder or Driver Reset

A 30-minute crash with no error log can be a GPU driver watchdog reset. OBS and TikTok Live Studio both rely on the GPU; a single reset kills the live session even if the app stays open.

Signs:
- OBS preview freezes while the game keeps running
- Event Viewer shows Display driver reset or TDR entries
- The stream ends without a visible crash dialog

Fixes:
- Update GPU drivers and roll back if the last update triggered the issue
- Switch encoder (NVENC ↔ x264) for a test session
- Reduce scene complexity (browser sources, animated overlays)

### Bucket 3: Network or Ingest Drop

If your connection flips for a second, TikTok’s ingest can drop your session. Thirty minutes can line up with router lease renewals, ISP traffic shaping, or overloaded upload.

Signs:
- Live ends but the app looks fine
- Stream ends more often on Wi-Fi than Ethernet
- Upload speed dips or spikes in the same time window

Fixes:
- Use Ethernet for one test stream
- Reboot the router before going live
- Switch to a different network to test if the crash disappears

## The 3-Bucket Fix (Step-by-Step)

1. **Run a controlled test stream** with a single scene and no overlays.
2. **Watch temperature or fan behavior** between 20–35 minutes.
3. **Check Event Viewer** for GPU driver reset messages right after the crash.
4. **Switch network** (Ethernet or mobile hotspot) for one test stream.
5. **Change only one variable per test** and log the result.

## Actionable Checklist

- Cap FPS and lower output resolution for one test stream
- Remove browser sources and heavy overlays
- Update GPU drivers and test a rollback if needed
- Stream once on Ethernet or a different Wi-Fi network
- Keep a simple crash log with time, symptoms, and changes

## FAQ

**Q: Is this a TikTok shadowban or content issue?**  
A: No. A consistent 30-minute crash is a technical stability issue, not a content visibility penalty.

**Q: It only crashes when I use TikTok Live Studio. Does that matter?**  
A: Yes. That points to GPU/encoder load or a Live Studio update conflict rather than TikTok’s backend alone.

**Q: What if the stream lasts longer when I lower bitrate?**  
A: That supports the network/ingest bucket. TikTok’s ingest is sensitive to sustained upload stability, not peak speed.

## Practical Conclusion

The 30-minute crash is not random. It’s a timer-based signal that points to one of three buckets. Diagnose the bucket first, then fix only that layer. That’s how you stop the loop of random tweaks and finally get a stable TikTok Live session.
