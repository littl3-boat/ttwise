## Introduction (Reddit-native context)

r/OBS threads keep repeating the same confusion: “OBS looks clean in preview, but my TikTok Live looks washed out and blocky.” Most people then crank resolution and FPS even higher, which actually makes TikTok’s encoder do **more damage**.

This post is a diagnostic. It explains why **resolution choices** hurt TikTok Live quality, and how to choose settings that survive TikTok’s mobile re-encode.

## Problem: Sharp in OBS, Soft on TikTok

OBS preview is local. TikTok Live is a multi-step pipeline: your encode, your upload, TikTok’s ingest, TikTok’s re-encode, then mobile playback. If any stage has too few bits for the number of pixels you send, the result turns soft or blocky.

Most “quality fixes” fail because they **increase pixels without increasing real bitrate headroom**, which collapses bits-per-pixel.

## Cause: Resolution Mismatch + Bits-Per-Pixel Collapse

  <p className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Cause chain: the common misattribution is blaming TikTok alone, but the root issue is sending too many pixels for the available bitrate, which forces a harsh re-encode.</p>
</div>

Three common traps create this collapse:

1. **Base and Output mismatch**  
   OBS keeps scaling every frame. That adds softness before TikTok even touches it.

2. **1080x1920 at 60 FPS without headroom**  
   You doubled frame count but didn’t double bitrate. Bits-per-pixel drops hard.

3. **TikTok re-encode on top of your stress test**  
   Even if your local encode is barely holding, TikTok must re-encode for mobile delivery, which makes the softness obvious.

## Fix: Make TikTok Do Less Work

Start with the assumption that TikTok will re-encode. Your job is to send it a clean, sustainable signal.

### Step 1: Match Base and Output

If your base canvas is 1080x1920, your output should be the same. If you want 720x1280 output, set the base to 720x1280 too. Avoid constant scaling.

### Step 2: Choose a Stable Baseline First

Start with **720x1280 @ 30 FPS**. This gives TikTok room to re-encode without destroying clarity. Only move up after a phone test looks clean for 10 minutes of real gameplay.

### Step 3: Control Bits-Per-Pixel

Resolution is not “better” if you can’t feed it. For most home uploads, 720p30 with 3000–4500 Kbps looks **cleaner** than 1080p60 at 4500–6000 Kbps.

### Step 4: Test on a Phone, Not OBS Preview

If it looks soft on a phone over cellular, it is soft. Fix resolution and bitrate first, then revisit FPS.

## Actionable Checklist

- [ ] Match Base and Output resolution in OBS
- [ ] Start at 720x1280 @ 30 FPS
- [ ] Use CBR and keep keyframes at 2 seconds
- [ ] Keep bitrate in a range your upload can actually sustain
- [ ] Phone-test on cellular for 10 minutes of real gameplay
- [ ] Only move to 1080x1920 after the phone test stays clean

## FAQ

**Q: Why does OBS preview look better than TikTok Live?**  
A: Preview is local and uncompressed. TikTok re-encodes your stream for mobile delivery, and any bitrate weakness becomes obvious.

**Q: Is 1080x1920 always worse?**  
A: Not always. It can look great if you have real bitrate headroom and zero encoding lag. Most small creators don’t, so 720p30 wins.

**Q: Should I use 60 FPS for fast games?**  
A: Only after you confirm zero encoding and rendering lag. A clean 30 FPS looks better than a “fake 60” stream with dropped frames.

**Q: Does matching Base and Output actually matter?**  
A: Yes. It removes constant scaling, which protects sharpness before TikTok even touches the feed.

## Practical Conclusion

If TikTok Live looks soft, don’t just crank resolution. Match base and output, start at 720p30, and protect bits-per-pixel. Once the phone test looks clean, you can scale up. Until then, stability beats “max quality” settings every time.
