## TL;DR
- **Core Pain**: OBS preview is buttery smooth, but the TikTok stream (usually via Virtual Camera or Live Studio) is lagging like a slideshow.
- **Search Intent**: Fix OBS preview not lagging but TikTok live laggy, low FPS issue.
- **Key Conclusion**: Smooth preview only means local rendering is successful. When GPU load hits 100%, Windows sacrifices background streaming software performance. You MUST "Run OBS as Administrator" and cap your game FPS.

## A Slideshow-Like Live Experience?

It’s the most frustrating moment in streaming: you’re looking at your second monitor, OBS shows 60 FPS, and the scene looks perfect. You’re playing your game, and it feels incredibly smooth.

But then you open your phone to check your own live room, or you see comments like:
*“Is the streamer playing on a slideshow?”*
*“This frame rate looks like it’s running on a toaster.”*

You’re confused: *“Why does my OBS show 0 dropped frames, but the live stream is lagging so hard?”*

This usually isn't a network issue—it's a "silent war" for resources inside your computer. In 2025, if you’re pushing TikTok Live (especially using **TikTok Live Studio** with **OBS Virtual Camera**), you are actually running two heavy broadcasting programs at the same time.

## The "Invisible" Performance Bottleneck

</div>

Most creators think lag = bad internet. But in this specific case, it’s usually **rendering lag** or **encoding overload**.

When your GPU usage hits 99%, Windows automatically lowers the priority of background applications. If OBS can only grab a tiny bit of leftover GPU performance, it handles the preview just fine, but it fails to consistently transmit every frame to the Virtual Camera or the streaming backend.

## Practical Steps to Fix the Lag

### 1. Run OBS as Administrator (Mandatory!)
This is the ultimate solution for 90% of OBS lag issues.
*   **The Principle**: Windows has a "Game Mode" that defaults all GPU performance to the current game.
*   **The Action**: Close OBS, right-click the icon, and select "Run as administrator."
*   **The Result**: Windows will treat OBS as a high-priority process. Even if the game wants to consume 100% of the performance, the system will forcibly reserve some GPU resources for OBS.

### 2. Cap Your In-Game Frame Rate (FPS)
If you don't set a limit, the game will try to run at 200+ FPS, eating up all GPU resources and leaving no performance for OBS to "composite the scene."
*   **The Action**: In your game settings, lock the frame rate to a multiple of your stream frame rate (e.g., 60, 120, or 144).
*   **The Goal**: Keep GPU usage below 90%.

### 3. Match Frame Rate Settings
A common mistake is having OBS set to 60 FPS while TikTok Live Studio is set to 30 FPS. This mismatch creates a visual "stutter," even if there are technically no dropped frames.
*   **The Check**: Ensure that the output FPS settings in both OBS and TikTok Live Studio are identical.

### 4. Disable "Double Preview"
If you are passing the OBS scene to TikTok Live Studio via Virtual Camera:
1.  Add the source in TikTok Live Studio.
2.  **Hide or minimize** the TikTok Live Studio preview window.
Rendering two sets of preview windows (one for OBS, one for TTLS) is a massive waste of resources.

## Summary

You don't need an expensive dual-PC setup to stream smoothly on TikTok. You just need to respect your GPU's limits. By running with administrator privileges and locking your game's frame rate, you ensure that OBS has enough "breathing room" to handle those buttery-smooth visuals.
