Moved your campaign online but still want the tactile map? An overhead camera can work—if you solve three things: framing, lighting, and stability. This distills advice from r/streaming and my own tests.

## TL;DR Gear Paths (Good → Better → Best)

- Phone as camera (Good): iPhone/Android + Camo/Reincubate or OBS Camera app; clamp arm above table.  
- Webcam (Better): Logitech StreamCam or Elgato Facecam Pro; use 1080p/60, manual focus if possible.  
- Mirrorless/Action Cam (Best): Sony ZV‑E10/Canon M50 or GoPro 10+; HDMI out → capture card → OBS.

Lighting: two soft lights at 45° to avoid glare; diffuse aggressively. For grid clarity, stop down (higher f‑number) and increase ISO minimally.

## Mounting That Doesn’t Wiggle

- Ceiling mount (most stable): small camera plate + 1/4\" pole from ceiling joist.  
- Wall boom arm: secure into studs; avoid desks (transfer shake).  
- C‑stand above table: quick to set up; add sandbags to legs for safety.

## When to Skip the Camera and Go VTT

If you already play online: Roll20, Foundry, or D&D Beyond’s VTT lets players move tokens, see fog of war, and reduces glare/legibility issues. You can still cut a “dice cam” for drama.

## Diagram: Overhead Tabletop Streaming Flow

### Diagram explanation

1) Camera source (phone/webcam/mirrorless) fixed overhead; power it so you’re not on battery.  
2) Clean HDMI or USB feed into capture (HD60 X or similar) → your PC.  
3) In OBS, crop to table edges, add grid/labels if needed, and scene switcher hotkeys.  
4) Audio stays on your main mic to keep voice quality consistent.  
5) Stream overlays: turn-based indicators, initiative order, and a small “GM hand” picture-in-picture if desired.

## Setup Checklist

- Hard‑mount > desk clamp to avoid wobble.  
- Lock exposure/white balance; autofocus hunts on minis.  
- Tape down cables; keep walkway clear.  
- Add a top‑down scene + a map‑detail scene; switch with a single key.
