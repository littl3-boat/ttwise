## The 3‑Day Week Template (repeatable)
- Day 1 — Anchor Night (High‑performing game): Set expectations up front; recap newcomers every 20–30 mins.
- Day 2 — Variety Island (2 blocks): 90 min “main” experiment + 45 min comfort capstone back to the anchor vibe.
- Day 3 — Community Night: Co‑op/party or themed challenges tied back to your persona, not a specific title.

Tip: If you stream 1–2 days/week, split a single session into halves: variety first, anchor second, so you never finish with zero momentum.

## Conversion Ladder: From Game Fans → You Fans
1) Rituals: repeat openings (“What are we grateful for?”) and sign‑offs to create identity.
2) Micro‑Asks: “If you enjoyed this bit, catch Variety Night on Thursdays—same vibe, different game.”
3) Roleplay Your POV: articulate why you like a moment independent of the title (challenge curve, story beats, discovery).
4) Highlights Packaging: title clips around your reactions/outcomes, not just the game name.

### Diagram explanation
Start by protecting the session that already performs (anchor). Add one variety island a week and only expand when retention holds. If variety underperforms twice in a row, reduce scope (shorter block, tighter hook) instead of abandoning it.

## Variety That Fits Your Persona
- Talk‑forward: story/puzzle/management sims where commentary carries; prep prompts.
- Chaos‑forward: roguelikes, party games, custom chat redeems during lulls.
- Craft‑forward: art/music/dev nights with visible milestones and time‑boxed goals.

## Titles and Thumbnails That Promise an Outcome
“Can I beat [X] with no map?” beats “Playing [X].”  
“Chat picks every upgrade” beats “Roguelike night.”  
Promise, constraints, stakes, recap = retention.
