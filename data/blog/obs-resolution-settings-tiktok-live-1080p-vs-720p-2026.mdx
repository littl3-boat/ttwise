      **Key Conclusion**: On TikTok, "High Resolution = High Quality" is a myth. Due to bitrate caps, 720p is often better for fast-paced gaming than 1080p.

## The Resolution Dilemma

A common question on r/OBS is:
> *"My internet is good, so I set OBS to 1080x1920. But my stream still looks blocky during gameplay. Should I downgrade to 720p?"*

The intuitive answer ("Higher resolution = Better quality") is **wrong** on TikTok Live.

Why? Because of **Bitrate Density**.

Imagine painting a wall.
- **1080p** is a huge wall.
- **720p** is a small wall.
- **Bitrate** is the amount of paint you have.

If TikTok only gives you one bucket of paint (limited bitrate), the small wall (720p) will look solid and rich. The big wall (1080p) will look patchy and thin.

## 1080x1920 (Vertical Full HD)

**The Specs:**
- **Resolution:** 1080 width x 1920 height
- **Required Bitrate:** 6000–8000 Kbps (Ideal) / 4000 Kbps (Minimum)
- **Sharpness:** High. Text looks crisp.

**Pros:**
- Look professional on large phones (iPhone Pro Max, S24 Ultra).
- Text overlays and chat are razor-sharp.
- "Just Chatting" or IRL streams look incredible.

**Cons:**
- **Artifacting:** Fast motion (turning quickly in COD) creates "squares" because the bitrate can't keep up with the pixel count.
- **Phone Heat:** Viewers with older phones may experience lag or overheating watching 1080p60 streams.
- **Instability:** Requires a flawless internet upload speed.

**Verdict:** Use 1080p **ONLY** if you are streaming slow-paced content (Hearthstone, Minecraft, Just Chatting) AND have excellent internet.

## 720x1280 (Vertical HD)

**The Specs:**
- **Resolution:** 720 width x 1280 height
- **Required Bitrate:** 3000–5000 Kbps
- **Sharpness:** Medium. Soft edges on small text.

**Pros:**
- **Smooth Motion:** Fast games look fluid because the encoder has fewer pixels to process.
- **Stability:** Much less likely to drop frames or buffer for viewers on 4G/5G.
- **Consistency:** 4000 Kbps at 720p looks *better* than 4000 Kbps at 1080p.

**Cons:**
- Small text might be slightly harder to read.
- Looks slightly "soft" on very large screens.

**Verdict:** The **Gold Standard** for fast-paced gaming (Apex, Fortnite, Valorant) or streamers with average internet.

## How to Set Custom Resolutions in OBS

OBS doesn't always show vertical resolutions in the dropdown menu. You have to force it.

1. Go to **Settings > Video**.
2. **Base (Canvas) Resolution**: Type `1080x1920` (manually type the 'x').
3. **Output (Scaled) Resolution**:
   - For 1080p: Type `1080x1920`
   - For 720p: Type `720x1280`
4. **Downscale Filter**:
   - If resolutions match (1080->1080), this is greyed out (Best performance).
   - If downscaling (1080->720), use **Lanczos** (Sharpened scaling, 36 samples).

## The "Safe Zone" Factor

Regardless of which resolution you pick, TikTok places UI elements (comment box, gift icons, profile pic) over your video.

**Crucial Tip:**
- The bottom **30%** of your screen is covered by chat.
- The top **15%** is covered by the "Follow" banner.
- The right **10%** is covered by likes/gift icons.

Keep your gameplay focus (crosshair, character) in the **middle 50%** of the screen.

## Conclusion

Don't let vanity numbers ruin your stream quality. A clean, smooth 720p stream will always retain more viewers than a buffering, blocky 1080p stream.

**Start with 720x1280 at 4000 Kbps.** Only upgrade to 1080p if you are sure your internet—and your game genre—can handle it.
