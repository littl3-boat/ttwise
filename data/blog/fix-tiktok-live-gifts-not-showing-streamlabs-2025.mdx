## TL;DR

TikTok gifts show as text pop-ups in Streamlabs but lack animations. The fix? Use Tikfinity to add custom animated GIFs for each gift, ensuring they're visible even in editor mode.

## Introduction

I've been there — you're multistreaming to TikTok and YouTube via Streamlabs, a viewer sends a galaxy, and all you see is a tiny text notification. No flashy animation, no excitement. From Reddit threads, this is a common frustration because Streamlabs doesn't yet support full TikTok alerts. Let's fix that so you can engage better and keep the energy up.

## Actionable Steps

1. **Install Tikfinity**: Download and set up Tikfinity (free tier works for basics). Connect it to your TikTok account for gift detection.

2. **Assign Animated GIFs**: In Tikfinity, map each TikTok gift (rose, galaxy, etc.) to a custom animated GIF. Source GIFs from online or create simple ones matching TikTok's style.

3. **Integrate with Streamlabs**: Add Tikfinity as a browser source in Streamlabs. Position it in a visible spot, like bottom-center, away from your main content.

4. **Test Visibility**: Go live in preview mode. Send test gifts via another account and adjust the source size/opacity so it's clear even in editor view.

5. **Monitor in Stream**: Use a secondary device or split-screen to watch the full stream view, ensuring animations play smoothly without overlapping key elements.

## FAQ / Notes

- **Does it show who sent the gift?** Yes, Tikfinity can include sender names in the alert.

- **Official support coming?** Streamlabs says they're working on it, but no ETA — this workaround bridges the gap.

- **Edge cases**: If animations lag, reduce GIF complexity or check your CPU usage. Not all gifts have perfect matches, so prioritize common ones like roses.

## Conclusion

With this setup, your TikTok gifts will feel alive again, helping you react faster and build better connections. It's a simple tweak that makes multistreaming way more fun — give it a shot on your next live.
