<TLDR>
  - **Core Pain**: Receiving gifts but the screen doesn't show effects, causing the host to miss the moment to thank viewers.
  - **Search Intent**: Fix TikFinity or StreamElements gift alerts not showing or delayed.
  - **Key Conclusion**: Check third-party tool permission tokens, OBS browser source cache, and the connection stability of the official TikTok API.
</TLDR>

## The Gift Alert Chain: Where it Breaks

To understand why a gift disappears, you have to look at the "Chain of Custody" for that digital data. It has to pass through four distinct gates before you see it.

**What this diagram shows:**
The most common failure happens at **Step 1**. If TikTok updates their API (usually weekly) and your alert tool hasn't refreshed its "Socket" connection, the signal breaks before reaching your software.

## 3 Reasons Your Gifts are 'Ghosting'

### 1. The Tikfinity Socket Timeout
If you use Tikfinity, it relies on a constant connection to your Live Chat. If you started Tikfinity *before* you actually went live, or if your internet flickered, the socket might look "Connected" but is actually dead.
*   **The Fix:** Go to Tikfinity → Setup → Click "Disconnected" and then "Connect" again while you are actively live.

### 2. The 'Low Value' Filter
Many new streamers accidentally turn on filters that hide "small" gifts like Roses or TikTok logos to prevent spam. 
*   **The Fix:** Check your alert settings. Ensure "Minimum Gift Value" is set to 1, not 10 or 100.

### 3. Hardware Acceleration Glitches
If you are using TikTok Live Studio or OBS Browser Sources, "Hardware Acceleration" can sometimes cause the overlay to stop rendering animations while the rest of the stream looks fine.
*   **The Fix:** Disable Hardware Acceleration in your OBS Advanced settings or try a "Window Capture" of the Tikfinity overlay page instead of a Browser Source.

## Diagnostic Checklist: How to Test Live

Don't wait for a "Galaxy" to find out if it's fixed. Follow these steps:

- [ ] **Check the Native Chat:** Look at the TikTok App on your phone. If the gift shows in the phone chat but not on your PC, it's an **Overlay/Connection issue**.
- [ ] **The 'Rose' Test:** Ask a regular viewer to send a single Rose. If it shows in chat but the alert doesn't pop, it's a **Tikfinity/Alert Tool setting issue**.
- [ ] **Refresh the Cache:** In OBS, right-click your Browser Source → "Refresh cache of current page." This forces the socket to re-handshake with the server.
- [ ] **Verify the Username:** Ensure the username in your alert tool matches your *current* TikTok handle exactly (including dots or underscores).

## FAQ: Real Questions from r/TikTokLive

**"Did TikTok take the money if the gift didn't show?"**
Yes. If the viewer lost coins, the gift was processed. You will still see it in your "LIVE Summary" earnings report after the stream ends, even if the alert never triggered.

**"Why do some gifts show up 5 minutes late?"**
This is "Server Lag." When TikTok's servers are overloaded (during major events), the API signal for gifts is deprioritized below the video stream. There is no fix for this other than waiting.

**"My goal bar is stuck but alerts are working. Why?"**
This usually means your "Goal" widget is connected to a different session ID. Delete the widget in Tikfinity and recreate it while the stream is live.

## Conclusion

"Ghost gifts" are almost never a sign that your account is broken or shadowbanned. They are a technical mismatch between TikTok’s high-speed chat API and your streaming software. By **re-syncing your alert tool socket** every time you go live, you can ensure that every "Galaxy" gets the reaction it deserves.
