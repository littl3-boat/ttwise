- Send video/audio to streaming PC
- Minimal overlay processing

**Streaming PC responsibilities:**
- Run TikTok Live Studio
- Process all overlays (Meld Studio, TikFinity, etc.)
- Handle Streamer.bot alerts
- Manage Stream Deck apps
- Encode and stream to TikTok

**Setup options:**

**Option A: Capture Card**
- Connect gaming PC to streaming PC via capture card
- Low latency
- Reliable performance
- Requires hardware purchase

**Option B: NDI (Network Device Interface)**
- Send video/audio over network
- No additional hardware needed
- Slightly higher latency
- Free solution

**Streaming PC requirements:**
- CPU: Ryzen 7 3700X or better (good for encoding)
- GPU: RTX 2070 Super or better (NVENC encoding)
- RAM: 16GB minimum, 32GB recommended
- Storage: SSD for faster loading

**Benefits:**
- Gaming PC performance unaffected
- Streaming PC can handle all overlays
- Better overall system stability
- Easier to troubleshoot issues

This is ideal if you have a second PC available and want to separate gaming and streaming workloads.

- Running many applications simultaneously

**RAM upgrade considerations:**
- DDR5 is expensive
- 64GB may be overkill for most streamers
- 32GB is usually sufficient
- Focus on optimizing usage first

**Alternative: Optimize RAM usage:**
- Close unnecessary applications
- Reduce browser tab count
- Use lighter overlay designs
- Disable unused features

Before upgrading RAM, verify it's actually the bottleneck. CPU or GPU might be the issue instead.

## Solution 4: Use Multistream Services to Reduce Load

Instead of running multiple browser tabs for each platform, use multistream services:

**Restream.io:**
- Stream to multiple platforms from one source
- Reduces browser tab overhead
- Centralized chat management
- May have TikTok limitations

**StreamElements SE Live:**
- Multistream plugin for OBS
- Reduces platform-specific overhead
