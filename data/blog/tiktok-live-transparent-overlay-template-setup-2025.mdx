*Design overlays that actually fit TikTok’s live UI — so nothing important gets covered by chat or headers.*

> Source discussion: “TikTok Live Template Transparent Overlay” — r/streaming. The post shares a transparent PNG template to help creators design overlays that respect TikTok’s chat and header areas.

## Why a Transparent Template Matters

TikTok’s live layout places a header at the top and a tall chat column along the right side on most phones. If you design a 1920×1080 overlay without accounting for those UI layers, your labels, tickers, and call‑to‑actions will end up hidden.

Using a transparent template as a guide lets you:

- See the **chat column** and **top header** areas ahead of time.
- Position critical elements (alerts, goals, labels) in **safe zones**.
- Keep lower‑thirds readable on both phone and desktop viewers.

---

## How to Use the Template Quickly

1. Load the **transparent overlay PNG** in your design tool (Figma, Photoshop, Canva).
2. Create a 1920×1080 canvas. Treat it like a **landscape frame**; TikTok will add chat and top bar.
3. Place your overlay elements (badges, labels, tickers) in the **left and bottom** areas primarily.
4. Export your overlay as a **PNG** and use it in OBS or TikTok Live Studio as a **browser/image source**.

Notes:

- The shared template was built against an **iPhone 13+** layout; exact chat/header sizes can vary across devices.
- If you stream in portrait (1080×1920), adapt the same safe‑zone thinking: avoid the right chat stack and the top header.

## Safe Zones for TikTok Overlays

The diagram below summarizes safe placement. Keep dynamic items (alerts, goals) away from the chat stack and the top header. Use bottom‑left for persistent labels and call‑to‑actions.

Below is a structured reading of the diagram:

- Top: **Header/UI** space; avoid tall banners here.
- Right: **Chat column**; avoid long scrolling tickers or dense text.
- Center: **Primary content focus**; use lightly‑animated elements only.
- Bottom‑left: **Persistent labels** (Now Playing, socials, schedule).
- Bottom‑center: **Short alerts/goals** with brief animations (0.2–0.4s).

---

## Practical Tips

- Prefer **short animations** over constant scrolling.
- Test overlays in a **real TikTok preview** when possible.
- Keep PNGs small; compress assets and avoid massive transparent layers.
- If overlays stutter in Live Studio, simplify effects or move heavy compositing to OBS.

Community members in r/streaming for sharing the transparent template and explaining why it helps with overlay positioning. If the template link expires, redraw a reference by taking a screenshot of your live UI and masking out the chat and header regions.
