## Introduction (Reddit-Native Context)

In r/OBS, a daily post appears: *"I have a 4090 and 1Gbps internet, but my stream looks blurry when I move. I'm using the recommended 1080p 6000kbps settings. Help!"*

The frustration is real because the logic seems sound: **Better Hardware + Higher Settings = Better Quality**, right?

Wrong. Streaming quality isn't about raw power; it's about **Data Density**. The "Recommended Settings" from 2020 are lying to you about how video compression actually works in 2026.

## The "Confetti Effect": Why Motion Kills Quality

When you stand still in a game, OBS only needs to send data for the few pixels that change (like a swaying tree). When you spin your camera or drive fast, **every single pixel changes** 60 times a second.

</div>

As the diagram shows, 6000 Kbps is plenty for a static image (Scenario A). But in high motion (Scenario B), the scene requires 12,000+ Kbps to maintain detail. Since Twitch/YouTube caps you at 6000-8000 Kbps, the encoder has to panic. It survives by **throwing away detail**, resulting in that blocky, blurry mess.

## The Solution: Increase "Bits Per Pixel" (BPP)

You can't increase the bitrate cap (platform rule). So, you must **decrease the canvas size**.

Think of bitrate like peanut butter. You have one spoonful (6000 Kbps).
- **1080p Canvas**: You spread it over a huge slice of bread. It's thin and transparent (blurry).
- **936p Canvas**: You spread it over a smaller cracker. It's thick and rich (sharp).

  <p className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Dropping to 936p increases your data density by nearly 50%, making motion look significantly clearer.</p>

## The "Golden Ratio" Settings Fix

Stop using 1080p for high-motion games (FPS, Racing, Action RPGs). Use these mathematically superior settings:

### 1. The Magic Resolution: 1664x936 (936p)
Why 936p? It is divisible by 8, which makes encoding efficient (mod8 compliant). It looks almost identical to 1080p on a phone screen but requires **30% less data**.

- **Settings > Video**
- Base Canvas: 1920x1080 (Your monitor)
- Output Scaled: **1664x936**
- Downscale Filter: **Lanczos** (Sharpened scaling, 36 samples)

### 2. Encoder Tuning
If you have an NVIDIA card, stop using the default preset.
- **Settings > Output > Streaming**
- Encoder: NVIDIA NVENC H.264
- Rate Control: CBR
- Bitrate: 6000 Kbps (Twitch) / 10000+ Kbps (YouTube)
- Preset: **P6: Slower (Better Quality)**
- Multipass Mode: Two Passes (Quarter Resolution)

### 3. Disable "Look-Ahead"
For fast-paced games, uncheck **Look-ahead**. It uses GPU resources to guess future frames, but in chaotic games (Apex, CoD), it often guesses wrong, wasting resources. Keep **Psycho Visual Tuning** CHECKED.

## Actionable Checklist

If your stream is still blurry, run this 30-second audit:

- [ ] **Check Resolution**: Are you strictly on 1664x936 (or 1280x720 if internet is weak)?
- [ ] **Check Bitrate**: Is it constant (CBR) at 6000+ Kbps?
- [ ] **Admin Mode**: Did you run OBS as Administrator? (Fixes GPU priority issues).
- [ ] **Game Mode**: Is Windows "Game Mode" ON? (It actually helps OBS now).

## FAQ

**Q: Why not just use 720p?**
A: 720p is great for density, but on a large desktop monitor, it can look a bit soft. 936p is the "Goldilocks" zone—sharp enough for PC viewers, dense enough for fast motion.

**Q: My upload speed is 500 Mbps, can I set bitrate to 20,000?**
A: No. Twitch limits ingest to ~8000 Kbps (officially 6000). YouTube allows more, but requires you to upscale to 1440p to unlock the better VP9 codec.

**Q: Does this apply to recording?**
A: No! For recording, use CQP (Constant Quantization Parameter) instead of CBR. Set CQP level to 20 for near-lossless quality.

## Conclusion

A blurry stream isn't a hardware failure; it's a math failure. By swallowing your pride and dropping from 1080p to 936p, you trade a "high spec" number for a "high quality" viewing experience. Your viewers don't care about your settings page; they care about seeing the headshot clearly.
