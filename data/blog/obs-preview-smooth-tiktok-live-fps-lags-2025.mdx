## TL;DR
- **Core Pain**: OBS preview shows 60 FPS, but watching the TikTok live on a phone feels like 30 FPS or lower, with a noticeable "dragging" sensation.
- **Search Intent**: Fix TikTok live "perceived frame rate" low, choppy video issues.
- **Key Conclusion**: TikTok is highly sensitive to encoding efficiency for vertical streams. Prioritize hardware encoders (NVENC/QuickSync) and limit game frame rates to 60 or 120 to free up GPU rendering bandwidth.

## Why is it 60 FPS Locally but Feels Like 30 FPS Live?

You might have encountered this: in the OBS preview window, the video is as smooth as silk, and the game frame rate is rock solid at 60 or higher. But when you pick up your phone and enter your own live room, you find the video has a strange "dragging" sensation, looking more like 30 FPS or even lower.

This **"Smooth Preview, Choppy Stream"** phenomenon usually happens because one link in the streaming chain (encoding, upload, or platform processing) has hit a bottleneck.

## Common Reasons for Low Perceived Frame Rate on TikTok

- **Encoder Overload**: If you use software encoding (x264), intense gameplay can cause micro-stutters and skipped frames.
- **Uncapped Game FPS**: If the game runs at 200+ FPS, it eats up GPU resources, leaving OBS without stable rendering bandwidth.
- **Bitrate Mismatch**: A bitrate that is too low cannot sustain the high frequency of updates needed for 60 FPS.
- **Platform Dynamic Throttling**: When upload stability is poor, TikTok may dynamically lower your frame rate to keep the stream from disconnecting.

## Steps to Fix: Restoring Smoothness to Your Stream

### 1. Optimize OBS Output Settings

- **Switch to Hardware Encoder**: Choose `NVENC` for NVIDIA cards or `QuickSync` for Intel.
- **Set Fixed Keyframe Interval**: Must be set to `2`.
- **Limit Game FPS**: Lock your in-game frame rate to 60 or 120.
- **Run OBS as Administrator**: This ensures Windows prioritizes GPU resource allocation for OBS rendering.

### 2. Test Real Bandwidth

Don't just look at peak numbers on speed test sites; look for sustained upload stability. If 60 FPS is still choppy, try dropping to **30 FPS** to observe. For most TikTok viewers (on mobile), a stable 30 FPS feels much better than a fluctuating 60 FPS.

No key? Keep scenes simple in Studio – no heavy overlays or effects.

  <p className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">FPS Lag Diagnosis Flowchart: This flow pinpoints whether your FPS drop is caused by encoding, game load, or the network. Usually, switching to 30 FPS will reveal the bottleneck—if the video becomes smooth, it means your setup cannot stably support 60 FPS.</p>

## Actionable Checklist

- [ ] Switch OBS encoder to hardware (NVENC/Quick Sync)
- [ ] Set FPS to 30, bitrate 2500-3500 Kbps
- [ ] Cap in-game FPS to 60-120
- [ ] Test stream on a phone for 5+ minutes
- [ ] Monitor OBS Stats for any lag indicators
- [ ] If using TikTok Live Studio, minimize scenes

## FAQ

### Why does my TikTok Live look 30FPS even if I set 60 in OBS?

TikTok may throttle to 30FPS if your bitrate is too low or connection unstable. Start at 30FPS for stability, then scale up.

### Is hardware encoding better for avoiding FPS lag?

Yes, it offloads work to your GPU, freeing CPU for gameplay. Most modern cards handle it way better than software for TikTok Live.

### OBS preview fine, but phone stream lags – is it my internet?

Often yes. Test upload with sustained loads (not just speed tests). Wired > WiFi for streaming.

### Can I achieve true 60FPS on TikTok Live without lag?

Absolutely, but it requires optimized settings, stable 10+ Mbps upload, and testing. Many creators stick to 30FPS for reliability on mobile viewers.

## Practical Conclusion

Getting your TikTok Live to feel as smooth as the OBS preview comes down to bridging that local-vs-remote gap. By starting with conservative settings, capping resources, and always testing on real devices, you will avoid the frustration of "invisible" lag. No need for a beast PC – just smart tweaks. Try these steps in your next stream, and watch viewer retention improve when the FPS finally matches what you see.
