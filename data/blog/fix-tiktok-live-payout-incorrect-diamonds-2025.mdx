</TLDR>

## The Mystery of the "Missing Money"

You just finished a massive live stream. You saw gifts flying—roses, galaxies, maybe even a Lion. Your "Estimated Diamonds" count hit several thousand. You quickly did the math in your head, waited for the payout, and then... the amount was significantly lower than you expected.

The immediate reaction is usually: *"TikTok is stealing my money."*

But before you submit a support ticket, you need to understand that TikTok's payout system is a complex series of conversions, commissions, and third-party fees. What feels like "missing money" is often just the reality of the platform's algorithm.

## The Root: A Three-Step Dilution Process

The confusion stems from a misunderstanding of how a viewer's dollar becomes a few cents in the creator's hand. Your income undergoes three specific "dilution" stages.

### 1. Coin to Gift Premium
Viewers buy **Coins**. TikTok charges different fees based on the purchase channel (App Store vs. Website). If a viewer buys coins on an iPhone, Apple takes 30% before TikTok even sees the money. This means the "value" of the gift is already shrunk before it appears on your screen.

### 2. The 50% Platform Commission
This is the big one. TikTok takes approximately **50%** of the net value of the gifts sent to you. When you receive a gift, TikTok converts its coin value into **Diamonds**. The diamond count you see in your dashboard is *already* the net amount after TikTok has taken its cut.

### 3. Fixed Diamond-to-USD Exchange Rate
This is where the math most often goes wrong. **1 Diamond does NOT equal 1 cent.**
The fixed payout rate is **1 Diamond = $0.005 USD** (half a cent).
If you have 10,000 Diamonds, you don't have $100. You have $50.

## Core Insight: Diamonds are "Net," Not "Gross"

The most important realization for any creator is: **Diamonds represent your share, not the total value of the gift.**

When you see "10,000 Diamonds" in your balance, that is the amount *after* TikTok's 50% commission has been deducted. You don't need to subtract another 50% from that number. However, you *do* need to account for withdrawal fees and currency conversion fees that happen *after* you hit the "Withdraw" button.

## Step-by-Step: Calculating Your True Payout

Stop guessing and start calculating. Use this process to find your actual expected deposit.

### 1. The "Half-Cent" Formula
Take your total Diamond count and multiply by 0.005.
*   **Example**: 5,000 Diamonds × 0.005 = **$25.00 USD**.

### 2. Factor in the "Withdrawal Tax"
When you move money from TikTok to PayPal or a bank account:
- **PayPal**: Usually charges a flat fee or a small percentage (typically $0.10 - $1.00 depending on region).
- **Exchange Rates**: If you aren't in the US, TikTok pays in USD. Your bank or PayPal will convert it to your local currency (GBP, EUR, etc.) using *their* rate, which is often lower than the mid-market rate. This can "lose" you another 3-5% of the total.

### 3. Check for "Settlement Lag"
Live revenue is not settled in real-time.
- **Estimated Diamonds**: Shown during the stream (unverified).
- **Total Balance**: Updates within 24-48 hours after the stream ends.
- **Withdrawal History**: Always check this tab to see if a specific payout was split or delayed due to "Review."

*This diagram illustrates why a $100 purchase by a fan results in roughly $33 in your pocket. The "incorrect" feeling usually comes from looking at the viewer's spend instead of the Diamond conversion.*

## Verification: How to Spot a Real Error

While most "incorrect" payouts are just math, actual errors *do* happen. Here is how to verify:

1.  **The Screenshot Audit**: Take a screenshot of your "Diamonds Earned" at the end of every stream.
2.  **The Math Check**: 48 hours later, go to **Settings > Balance > Live Rewards**. Does the "Total Diamonds" increase by the amount in your screenshot?
3.  **The Withdrawal Log**: If the numbers match in the app but not in your bank, the issue is your **Payment Method** (PayPal/Bank), not TikTok. Check your transaction history for "Service Fees."

### When to Contact Support
If your Diamond count in the "Balance" tab is lower than the "Diamonds Earned" in your Live Analytics after 72 hours, this is a technical glitch. Submit a ticket with screenshots of both screens.

By understanding that 1 Diamond = $0.005 and accounting for the 50% platform cut, you can manage your expectations and treat your TikTok Live as the business it actually is.
