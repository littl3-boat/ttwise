## Introduction

In r/TikTokCreators, the most common frustration isn't getting zero views—it's getting **exactly the same views** every time.

"I hit 200 viewers in 10 minutes, and then it just... stops. It flatlines. Is the algorithm broken?"

No. The algorithm is working perfectly. It has sorted you into a "safe bucket" because you haven't given it the specific data signal it needs to risk sending you more traffic. You are stuck in the **Calibration Phase**.

## The 3 Buckets of Live Traffic

TikTok Live doesn't feed you viewers linearly. It feeds you in **step functions** (buckets). You have to "graduate" from one bucket to unlock the next.

  <p className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">The 3 Buckets: Seed (Stability), Calibration (Retention), and Scaling (Monetization). Most creators get stuck in Calibration.</p>
</div>

### Bucket 1: The Seed (0–200 Views)
**Goal:** Technical Stability.
When you start, TikTok sends a small "seed" audience. It is checking:
- Does the stream crash?
- is the audio clear?
- Do people leave immediately (bounce rate)?

If you pass this, you move to Bucket 2. If you fail (e.g., bad audio, lag), you stay here forever.

### Bucket 2: Calibration (200–1000 Views) — **THE PLATEAU**
**Goal:** Audience Fit.
This is where 90% of creators get stuck. TikTok sends you a steady trickle of viewers to see *who* likes you.
- If you have 200 viewers but they only stay for 10 seconds, TikTok says: "We can't find a match. Stop sending new people."
- **The Trap:** You think you need *more* viewers to grow. But TikTok won't give you more until you prove you can keep the ones you have.

### Bucket 3: Scaling (1000+ Views)
**Goal:** Monetization & Virality.
Once you prove high retention in Bucket 2, the floodgates open. Now TikTok cares about gifts, shares, and "share of attention."

## Why You Are Stuck (The Math)

The plateau happens because your **Retention Density** is too low.

Retention Density = (Total Watch Time) / (Total Unique Viewers)

If 1000 people enter your stream but only watch for 30 seconds each, your density is low.
If 200 people enter but watch for 5 minutes each, your density is high.

**TikTok favors high density.** It would rather send traffic to a room where 200 people are glued to the screen than a room where 1000 people are cycling in and out like a revolving door.

## How to Break the Ceiling (The Fix)

To escape the Calibration Bucket, you must stop trying to get "new" viewers and start freezing the ones you have.

### 1. The "Reset" Strategy
If you've been stuck at 200 for months, your account has a "retention memory." You need to shock the system.
- **Change the Format:** If you usually just game, do a "Just Chatting" intro for 20 minutes.
- **Change the Time:** Stream 3 hours earlier than usual to hit a different geographic server bucket.

### 2. The "Hook" Audit
Watch your own VOD. When a new viewer enters, what do they hear in the first 3 seconds?
- **Bad:** Silence, or "Welcome user123."
- **Good:** Context. "We are currently trying to beat this boss without using healing items."
**Rule:** Always be narrating the *stakes*, not just the action.

### 3. Stop Welcoming Bots
Don't say "Hello" to every username that joins. It kills the flow for the 190 people already watching. Only address chatters who *type*. This keeps the energy focused on the content, increasing retention for the silent majority (lurkers).

## Actionable Checklist

- [ ] **Check Audio:** Is your mic balanced with game audio? (Technical failure keeps you in Bucket 1).
- [ ] **Define the Stakes:** Put a text overlay on screen explaining *what* you are doing (e.g., "Ranked Push: Gold to Plat").
- [ ] **Ignore the Counter:** Hide your view count. Staring at "198... 201... 199" makes you anxious and lowers your energy.
- [ ] **Audit Retention:** After the stream, look at "Average Watch Time." If it's under 60s, you have a content problem, not an algorithm problem.

## FAQ

**Q: Is it a shadowban?**
A: Rarely. A shadowban means 0 views. A plateau (200 views) means you are indexable but average.

**Q: Should I make a new account?**
A: No. A new account just puts you back in Bucket 1. You'll hit the same ceiling in 2 weeks if you don't fix the retention density.

**Q: Does buying promotions help?**
A: It can hurt. Promo views usually have terrible retention. They dilute your density metrics, making the algorithm think your stream is *worse* than it is.

## Practical Conclusion

The 200-view plateau is a safety mechanism. It protects the platform from pushing boring content to thousands of people. To break it, you don't need to "hack" the algorithm. You need to prove to the algorithm that when it sends a viewer to your room, that viewer **stops scrolling**.

Focus on holding 200 people for 5 minutes, and the algorithm will trust you with 500.
