*Streaming from a single monitor? You don't need a second screen to see TikTok chat. Here's how to set up chat overlays that work with your one-monitor setup.*

> Source discussion: "One monitor: webcam, game, chat" — r/streaming. Core problem: creators streaming from a **single monitor** (or TV) want to see **TikTok chat, webcam preview, and gameplay** all on one screen, but OBS overlays disappear when they switch to fullscreen games.

## The Single Monitor Streaming Challenge

When you're streaming from a single monitor, you face a unique challenge:

- **You need to see**: Gameplay, webcam preview, TikTok chat, and OBS controls.
- **You have**: One screen.
- **The problem**: When you go fullscreen in a game, OBS disappears, and you can't see chat or your webcam preview.

The Reddit post that inspired this guide came from a creator who said: *"when I leave the OBS window to play a game, my chat overlay and webcam image disappear."*

This is a common issue, but there are several solutions.

## Understanding How OBS Overlays Work

First, let's clarify what's happening:

### What You See vs What Viewers See

- **What you see on your monitor**: Your game in fullscreen, OBS window (if visible).
- **What viewers see on stream**: Your OBS scene (gameplay + webcam + chat overlay).

**Important**: Your OBS scene **continues streaming** even when OBS is minimized or hidden. Viewers still see your webcam and chat overlay.

**The issue**: You can't **see** your chat or webcam preview when OBS is hidden.

The diagram shows five main solutions:

- **Solution 1: Use Phone for Chat**: Free, no setup, but small screen and battery drain.

## Solution 1: Use Your Phone for Chat (Easiest)

## Solution 2: Use Chat Apps (Better Than Phone TikTok App)

Dedicated chat apps are better than the TikTok app for monitoring chat:

## Solution 3: Use OBS Chat Dock (If Available)

Some versions of OBS support chat docks that stay visible:

### Step 1: Enable Chat Dock

1. **Open OBS Studio**.
2. **Go to "Docks"** → **"Custom Browser Docks"** (if available).
3. **Add TikTok chat URL** as a dock.

## Solution 4: Use Picture-in-Picture (PIP) Overlay

Create a picture-in-picture overlay that shows chat on your stream and on your monitor:

### Step 1: Set Up Chat Overlay in OBS

1. **In OBS**, add **Browser Source** for TikTok chat.
2. **Position chat overlay** in a corner (for stream).
3. **Make it large enough** to read.

### Step 2: Use OBS Preview on Second Device

1. **Use phone or tablet** to view OBS preview.

**Note**: This requires additional setup and may not be practical for single-monitor setups.

2. **Check if TikTok support** is available.
3. **Overlay chat** on your game screen.

**Note**: TikTok chat overlay software is less common than Twitch/YouTube options.

## Solution 6: Use Windowed Borderless Mode

If your game supports windowed borderless mode:

### Step 1: Enable Windowed Borderless

1. **In game settings**, select **"Windowed Borderless"** (not fullscreen).
2. **Game runs** in a window (but looks fullscreen).

### Step 2: Position OBS Next to Game

1. **Resize game window** to leave space for OBS.
2. **Position OBS** next to game window.
3. **See chat and webcam preview** while gaming.

**Pros**:

**Cons**:
- **Requires additional hardware** (cost).
- **Takes up desk space**.
