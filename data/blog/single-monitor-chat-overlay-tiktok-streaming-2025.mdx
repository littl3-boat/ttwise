- **The problem**: When you go fullscreen in a game, OBS disappears, and you can't see chat or your webcam preview.

## Solution 1: Use Your Phone for Chat (Easiest)

The simplest solution is to use your phone to monitor TikTok chat:

### Step 1: Install TikTok App on Phone

1. **Download TikTok app** (if not already installed).
2. **Log in** to your TikTok account.

### Step 2: Join Your Own Stream

1. **Start your TikTok Live stream** on PC.
2. **On your phone**, open TikTok app.
3. **Search for your username** or go to your profile.
4. **Tap "Live"** to join your own stream.
5. **View chat** on your phone while gaming on PC.

### Step 3: Position Your Phone

- **Place phone** next to your monitor (on desk or stand).
- **Keep it visible** while gaming.
- **Read chat** without alt-tabbing.

**Pros**:
- **Free** (no additional hardware).
- **Real-time chat** (same as viewers see).
- **No setup required**.

**Cons**:
- **Small screen** (harder to read).
- **Battery drain** (keep phone plugged in).
- **Takes up desk space**.

## Solution 2: Use Chat Apps (Better Than Phone TikTok App)

Dedicated chat apps are better than the TikTok app for monitoring chat:

### Option A: Chatsen (Recommended)

1. **Download Chatsen** (free app for iOS/Android).
2. **Connect TikTok account**.
3. **View chat** in a clean, readable interface.
4. **Place phone** next to monitor.

**Features**:
- **Large, readable text**.

- **Notifications** for new messages.
- **Works with multiple platforms** (Twitch, YouTube, TikTok).

### Option B: Streamlabs Mobile App

2. **Connect TikTok account** (if supported).
3. **View chat** and stream stats.

**Note**: Streamlabs mobile app may have limited TikTok support. Check if TikTok is available in your region.

## Solution 3: Use OBS Chat Dock (If Available)

Some versions of OBS support chat docks that stay visible:

### Step 1: Enable Chat Dock

1. **Open OBS Studio**.
2. **Go to "Docks"** → **"Custom Browser Docks"** (if available).
3. **Add TikTok chat URL** as a dock.

**Note**: TikTok doesn't provide a pop-out chat URL like Twitch does. This may not work for TikTok.

### Step 2: Keep OBS Visible (Windowed Mode)

1. **Run game in windowed mode** (not fullscreen).
2. **Resize game window** to leave space for OBS.
3. **Position OBS chat dock** next to game window.
4. **See chat** while gaming.

**Pros**:
- **Integrated** (no phone needed).
- **Large, readable chat**.

**Cons**:

- **Takes up screen space**.
- **May not work with TikTok** (limited chat URL support).

## Solution 4: Use Picture-in-Picture (PIP) Overlay

Create a picture-in-picture overlay that shows chat on your stream and on your monitor:

### Step 1: Set Up Chat Overlay in OBS

1. **In OBS**, add **Browser Source** for TikTok chat.
2. **Position chat overlay** in a corner (for stream).
3. **Make it large enough** to read.

### Step 2: Use OBS Preview on Second Device

1. **Use phone or tablet** to view OBS preview.
2. **Connect phone to OBS** using OBS Remote or similar.
3. **View chat overlay** on phone while gaming.

**Note**: This requires additional setup and may not be practical for single-monitor setups.

## Solution 5: Use Game Overlay Software (Advanced)

Some software can overlay chat directly on your game:

### Option A: Overwolf Apps

1. **Install Overwolf** (free gaming overlay platform).
2. **Search for TikTok chat overlay apps**.
3. **Install app** that displays TikTok chat over games.
4. **See chat** while gaming in fullscreen.

**Note**: TikTok chat overlay apps may not be available on Overwolf. Check availability.

### Option B: Custom Overlay Software

1. **Use software like "Chatty"** (for Twitch) or similar.
2. **Check if TikTok support** is available.
3. **Overlay chat** on your game screen.

**Note**: TikTok chat overlay software is less common than Twitch/YouTube options.

## Solution 6: Use Windowed Borderless Mode

If your game supports windowed borderless mode:

### Step 1: Enable Windowed Borderless

1. **In game settings**, select **"Windowed Borderless"** (not fullscreen).
2. **Game runs** in a window (but looks fullscreen).

### Step 2: Position OBS Next to Game

1. **Resize game window** to leave space for OBS.
2. **Position OBS** next to game window.
3. **See chat and webcam preview** while gaming.

**Pros**:
- **No alt-tabbing** required.
- **See everything** on one screen.

**Cons**:
- **Takes up screen space** (smaller game window).
- **May impact game performance** (depending on game).
- **Not all games support** windowed borderless.

## Solution 7: Use a Cheap Second Monitor (Best Long-Term Solution)

If you're serious about streaming, a second monitor is the best investment:

### Budget Options

1. **Used monitor** (Facebook Marketplace, $20-50).
2. **Small monitor** (19-22 inches, $50-100).
3. **TV as second monitor** (if you have a spare TV).

### Setup

1. **Connect second monitor** to your PC.
2. **Extend display** (not duplicate).
3. **Run OBS on second monitor**.
4. **Run game on main monitor**.
5. **See chat, webcam, and OBS** on second monitor.

**Pros**:
- **Best experience** (see everything).
- **No compromises** (fullscreen gaming + full OBS visibility).
- **Professional setup**.

**Cons**:
- **Requires additional hardware** (cost).
- **Takes up desk space**.
