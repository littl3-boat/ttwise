When you're multi-streaming to Twitch, YouTube, and TikTok, you're dealing with three different platforms that handle overlays differently:

- **Twitch**: StreamElements has native integration — overlays work out of the box.
- **YouTube**: StreamElements supports YouTube Live — overlays work with proper setup.
- **TikTok**: StreamElements **doesn't have native TikTok integration** — this is where things break.

*How to route your overlays correctly when streaming to multiple platforms simultaneously.*

## The Core Problem: TikTok Event Integration

StreamElements overlays are **event-driven**. They respond to:
- New followers
- Subscriptions
- Donations
- Chat messages
- Channel point redemptions

**TikTok has different events:**
- Follows (similar to Twitch)
- Gifts (digital roses, coins)
- Likes (heart taps)
- Comments
- Shares

**StreamElements doesn't connect to TikTok's API** to receive these events, so your overlays can't trigger.

---

## Solution 1: Use TikFinity for TikTok-Specific Overlays

**TikFinity** is built specifically for TikTok Live and supports all TikTok events.

### Setting Up TikFinity for Multi-Stream

1. **Create a TikFinity account** at tikfinity.com.
2. **Connect your TikTok account** (authorize TikFinity to access your live stream data).
3. **Set up TikTok-specific overlays**:
   - Gift alerts (roses, coins)
   - Like counters
   - Follower alerts
   - Chat overlay
4. **Get your TikFinity overlay URL**.
5. **Add to OBS as a Browser Source**:
   - In OBS, add a **Browser Source**.
   - Paste your TikFinity overlay URL.
   - Set resolution (1920×1080 for horizontal, 1080×1920 for vertical).
6. **Route to TikTok only**:
   - If using Restream, TikFinity overlays will appear on all platforms (not ideal).
   - If using SE Live plugin, you can create a **TikTok-specific scene** with TikFinity overlays.

### TikFinity Limitations

- **Free tier limits**: Limited customization and slower update speeds.
- **Server reliability**: Can be slow or disconnect during peak times.
- **TikTok-only**: Doesn't work with Twitch or YouTube events.

---

## Solution 2: Create Platform-Specific Scenes in OBS

If you're using the **SE Live plugin** (not Restream), you can create separate scenes for each platform:

### Step 1: Create Scene Structure

- **Scene: Twitch/YouTube** (with StreamElements overlays)
- **Scene: TikTok** (with TikFinity overlays)
- **Scene: Base** (gameplay, webcam — no overlays)

### Step 2: Configure SE Live Plugin

1. **In OBS**, go to **Tools** → **StreamElements Live**.
2. **Add streaming destinations**:
   - Twitch (with StreamElements overlays)
   - YouTube (with StreamElements overlays)
   - TikTok (without StreamElements overlays, use TikFinity instead)
3. **Assign scenes to platforms**:
   - Twitch → Scene: Twitch/YouTube
   - YouTube → Scene: Twitch/YouTube
   - TikTok → Scene: TikTok

### Step 3: Switch Scenes During Stream

- **For Twitch/YouTube**: Use the Twitch/YouTube scene.
- **For TikTok**: Switch to the TikTok scene (with TikFinity overlays).

**Note**: This requires manual scene switching, which isn't ideal for live streams.

---

## Solution 3: Use Restream with Conditional Overlays

If you're using **Restream**, you can't easily separate overlays by platform. However, you can:

1. **Keep StreamElements overlays** for Twitch/YouTube events (they'll show on all platforms).
2. **Add TikFinity overlays** for TikTok-specific events (they'll also show on all platforms).
3. **Accept that some overlays will appear on all platforms** (not ideal, but functional).

**Better approach**: Use **SE Live plugin** instead of Restream if you need platform-specific overlays.

## Why Restream Doesn't Break StreamElements Overlays

The Reddit post asked: *"Can restream interfere with that?"*

**Answer: No.** Restream is just a **stream distributor**. It takes your OBS output and sends it to multiple platforms. It doesn't interfere with StreamElements overlays.

**The real issue**: StreamElements overlays **work fine** on Twitch and YouTube, but **TikTok doesn't support StreamElements events**, so TikTok-specific overlays (gifts, likes) won't trigger.

---

## Performance: SE Live Plugin vs Restream

The Reddit post also asked: *"Does the SE live obs plug in for multi streaming use more of your computer than restream?"*

**Answer: Yes.**

### SE Live Plugin Performance

- **CPU/GPU usage**: Higher (encoding multiple streams).
- **Bandwidth usage**: Higher (uploading multiple streams).
- **FPS impact**: More noticeable (especially with lower-end hardware).

### Restream Performance

- **CPU/GPU usage**: Lower (encoding one stream).
- **Bandwidth usage**: Lower (uploading one stream to Restream).
- **FPS impact**: Less noticeable.

**Trade-off**: Restream is easier on your PC, but you lose platform-specific overlay control.

## Complete Multi-Stream Overlay Setup

Here's the recommended setup for multi-streaming with working overlays:

### For Twitch and YouTube

1. **Use StreamElements**:
   - Set up overlays in StreamElements dashboard.
   - Connect Twitch and YouTube accounts.
   - Add overlays to OBS as Browser Sources.

### For TikTok

1. **Use TikFinity**:
   - Set up TikTok-specific overlays in TikFinity.
   - Connect TikTok account.
   - Add TikFinity overlays to OBS as Browser Sources.

### For Multi-Streaming

1. **Use SE Live Plugin** (if you need platform-specific overlays):
   - Create separate scenes for TikTok vs Twitch/YouTube.
   - Assign scenes to platforms in SE Live plugin.
   - Switch scenes manually during stream.

2. **Or use Restream** (if you want simpler setup):
   - Accept that StreamElements overlays will show on all platforms.
   - Add TikFinity overlays for TikTok events (they'll also show on all platforms).

## Troubleshooting: Overlays Still Not Working

If your overlays still aren't working after following these steps:

### Check 1: Browser Source Settings

- **URL is correct**: Double-check your StreamElements/TikFinity overlay URL.
- **Resolution matches**: Set width/height to match your stream resolution.
- **Refresh browser source**: Right-click Browser Source → **Refresh**.

### Check 2: Account Connections

- **StreamElements**: Verify Twitch/YouTube accounts are connected.
- **TikFinity**: Verify TikTok account is connected and authorized.

### Check 3: OBS Scene Setup

- **Overlays are in the correct scene**: Make sure Browser Sources are in the active scene.
- **Sources are visible**: Check that Browser Sources aren't hidden or disabled.

### Check 4: Platform-Specific Issues

- **TikTok**: StreamElements overlays won't work — use TikFinity instead.
- **Twitch/YouTube**: StreamElements overlays should work — check account connections.

## Final Take: Multi-Stream Overlays Require Multiple Tools

The Reddit post that inspired this guide came from a creator who was **"trying to narrow down"** why their overlays weren't working when multi-streaming.

The answer: **StreamElements works great for Twitch and YouTube, but TikTok requires TikFinity.**

You can't use one tool for all platforms — you need:
- **StreamElements** for Twitch/YouTube overlays.
- **TikFinity** for TikTok overlays.

And if you want platform-specific overlays, you need to use **SE Live plugin** (not Restream) and create separate scenes for each platform.

It's more complex than single-platform streaming, but it's the only way to get overlays working on all platforms.
