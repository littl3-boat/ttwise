</TLDR>

*Even if you have a top-tier GPU, incorrect settings can make your TikTok Live stream look like a slideshow. The problem isn't hardware performance—it's how the software handles browser sources and refresh rate synchronization.*

## "I have an RTX 4090, why is my stream still choppy?"

It sounds illogical. You can run AAA games at 4K 144FPS smoothly, but a simple TikTok Live preview feels "heavy."

Specifically:
- **Scrolling text** (like new follower alerts) looks ghosted or jittery.
- **TikFinity plugins** (donations, widgets) look like they're running at 15 FPS.
- **The game itself is smooth**, but viewers report the stream looks jumpy.

This is usually a configuration conflict, not a hardware bottleneck. Here are the 5 most common mistakes and how to fix them.

## Mistake 1: Not Locking Canvas FPS

</div>

**The Myth:** Let TikTok Live Studio run at "unlimited" FPS or try to match your monitor's 144Hz.
**The Reality:** TikTok servers only receive **60 FPS**. If your canvas tries to render at 144 FPS while the encoder forces a 60 FPS pull, you get severe **Frame Pacing Stutter**.

**The Fix:**
1. Go to **Settings** > **Video**.
2. Set **FPS** strictly to **60**.
3. Do NOT use "Match Monitor" or "Unlimited" options.

## Mistake 2: Browser Source Hardware Acceleration Conflict

**The Myth:** Enable "Hardware Acceleration" for every TikFinity plugin or web widget.
**The Reality:** TikTok Live Studio is built on Electron (like a browser). When you have 5+ browser sources competing for GPU priority, the **overlay rendering thread** gets blocked.

**The Fix:**
- For simple text or static image plugins, **disable** hardware acceleration if the option is available.
- Try to combine multiple TikFinity widgets into a single browser source URL instead of adding 5 separate layers.

---

## Mistake 3: The "Window Capture" vs. "Game Capture" Trap

**The Myth:** Use "Window Capture" for high-action games.
**The Reality:** Window capture is inefficient and introduces input lag. It often fails to hook into the frame buffer directly, causing the stream to look "choppy" even if the FPS counter says 60.

**The Fix:**
- Always use **Game Capture** for gaming streams.
- Only use Window Capture for static apps like Discord or Spotify.

## Mistake 4: Missing Administrator Permissions

**The Myth:** Running TikTok Live Studio normally is fine.
**The Reality:** Windows prioritizes resources for the "Active Window" (your game). If TikTok Live Studio isn't run as Administrator, Windows will starve its encoding thread when the game gets intense.

**The Fix:**
- Right-click the TikTok Live Studio shortcut > **Properties** > **Compatibility**.
- Check **"Run this program as an administrator"**.

---

## Mistake 5: GPU Overload (No Overhead)

**The Myth:** "My GPU is only at 90% usage, I'm fine."
**The Reality:** Streaming requires about 10-15% of GPU overhead for compositing the scene (the "render" stage before "encoding"). If your game is using 99% of your GPU, the stream *will* stutter because it can't find a gap to render its own frame.

**The Fix:**
- Use an in-game FPS cap. If you have a 144Hz monitor, cap your game at 141 or 120 FPS to leave breathing room for the stream software.

## FAQ: Why does it only lag when I have TikFinity open?
TikFinity uses a lot of JavaScript. If you have many animations (like rain or floating emotes), it eats CPU cycles. Ensure you aren't running the TikFinity dashboard in a Chrome tab *while* also having the browser source in TikTok Live Studio. Close the extra tabs!

## Practical Conclusion
Smoothness on TikTok Live isn't about raw power; it's about **alignment**. Lock your FPS to 60, run as Administrator, and ensure your game isn't cannibalizing 100% of your GPU resources.

**Next Action:** Open TikTok Live Studio, set your FPS to 60, and restart it as Administrator. You will likely see an immediate 50% improvement in "felt" smoothness.
