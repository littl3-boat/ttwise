<TLDR>
  - **Browser Throttling**: Keep your TikFinity overlay in a dedicated, foregrounded browser window to prevent Windows from deprioritizing its resource usage.
  - **Websocket vs Polling**: Ensure your alert tool uses websockets for real-time delivery; polling methods add inherent 3-5 second delays.
  - **Scene Optimization**: Reduce the complexity of your overlay DOM (fonts, heavy animations) to minimize the rendering time in your browser source.
  - **Hardware Sync**: Use a wired Ethernet connection for both your gaming and streaming PCs to eliminate the jitter that causes goal-bar desync.
</TLDR>

## What Causes Tikfinity Delay?

![Lag Mitigation](/static/images/tikfinity-delay-fixes-and-alternatives-obs-tiktok-live-2025/explain-1.svg)

Alert delay usually stacks from multiple small latencies:
- TikTok event propagation and API/websocket timing
- Network RTT and jitter
- Browser performance (overlay tab throttling, heavy scenes)
- OBS render/compositing delay (if captured)
- Platform‑side replay/windowing for fraud prevention

In isolation each is minor; together they create visible lag for goals, alerts, and on‑screen counters.

---

## Quick Wins (Do These First)

1) Use a dedicated browser window for overlays  
- Single profile with no extensions  
- Hardware acceleration ON  
- Keep the overlay tab foregrounded (browsers throttle background tabs)

2) Hard‑wire your streaming PC  
- Ethernet for both streaming and overlay machine  
- Avoid Wi‑Fi hopping/buffering

3) Lower overlay workload  
- Prefer lightweight fonts/animations  
- Limit DOM nodes and simultaneous counters  
- 60 FPS browser cap is enough; avoid unnecessary canvases

4) Sync goal cadence  
- Increase goal update frequency on the overlay provider (if configurable)  
- Prefer websocket over polling endpoints

## OBS and TikTok Live: What Actually Works in 2025

- TikTok Live Studio is still the official desktop app.  
- Many creators stream with OBS by using stream keys that TikTok grants to eligible accounts/partners or via approved relay methods.  
- If you have a stream key, OBS works well. If you don’t, you’ll likely be confined to Live Studio on desktop or mobile capture workflows.

Best practice when stuck with Live Studio: run your Tikfinity overlay in a separate browser window and capture that window as a source; keep it un-obstructed and foregrounded to avoid throttling.

## Alternatives to Tikfinity (And When to Use Them)

- TikTok Alerts via StreamElements/Streamlabs: reliable, polished, but fewer TikTok‑specific triggers.  
- Community/self‑hosted overlay frameworks (e.g., OBS Browser Source + custom HTML/WS): maximum control, requires dev time.  
- Newer services pop up often; test stability and websocket responsiveness before a full switch.

Tip: Whichever you choose, verify that events are pushed over websockets and not long‑polling. Push beats polling for real‑time goals.

## Where The Delay Comes From (Diagram)

![Tikfinity Latency Sequence](/static/images/tikfinity-delay-fixes-and-alternatives-obs-tiktok-live-2025/diagram-1.svg)

Below is the logic this diagram represents:
- Viewer action triggers a TikTok event.
- TikTok processes the event and exposes it to the alert provider.
- The overlay receives the event over a websocket.
- The browser renders the animation; OBS captures it; stream is encoded and delivered.
- Each hop adds 10–150 ms; combined, you feel a 300–1200 ms delay.

---

## Mitigation Playbook (Flow)

Follow this order:
1) Network: wired > Wi‑Fi, close high‑latency background traffic.  
2) Browser: foreground overlay tab, hardware acceleration on, strip extensions.  
3) Overlay: reduce animations/weights, prefer websocket, tighten goal sync.  
4) OBS: disable filters you don’t need; ensure Browser Source FPS matches overlay caps.  
5) Platform: accept a small platform buffer; you’re aiming to minimize, not eliminate, delay.

## Practical OBS Settings (If You Have a Stream Key)

- Encoder: hardware (NVENC/AMF/VT) when available  
- Rate control: CBR  
- Keyframe interval: 2s  
- B‑frames: 2 (typical)  
- Browser Source: FPS 30–60, hardware acceleration on  
- Scene transitions: short and simple to avoid extra frames

---

## Final Take

You can’t remove every millisecond of delay, but you can keep alerts “feel‑real‑time.” Prioritize wired networking, an optimized overlay tab, and websocket‑driven providers. If you have a TikTok stream key, OBS plus a lean overlay stack is the most responsive setup in 2025.
