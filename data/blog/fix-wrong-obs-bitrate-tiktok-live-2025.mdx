## Why Your Bitrate Setting Is Always "Wrong"?

If you're setting up OBS based on Twitch or YouTube experience, you'll likely fail on TikTok. Many creators on Reddit complain about streams lagging like a slideshow or faces being too blurry to see. The core reason is a lack of optimization for TikTok's ingest bandwidth.

### 1. Core Operational Steps

Adjust your OBS bitrate following this flowchart, which can directly solve 90% of lag issues.

</div>

1.  **Adjust Canvas Resolution**: Go to OBS settings and set the canvas to 1080x1920 (vertical). Don't use 1920x1080 and then force a crop; this wastes significant encoding performance.
2.  **Set Target Bitrate**: In "Output" settings, lock the bitrate between **2500 - 3500 Kbps**. Don't exceed 6000; TikTok's distribution logic for mobile users favors stability over extreme high bitrates.
3.  **Select Encoder**:
    *   **NVIDIA GPU**: Select NVENC H.264 (new), the most stable solution currently.
    *   **AMD GPU**: Select AMF encoding.
    *   **Excessive CPU Performance**: Select x264.
4.  **Configure Virtual Camera**: If you stream through TikTok Live Studio, start the OBS Virtual Camera and use it as an input source in Studio.

## Bitrate vs. Stability: TikTok's Balancing Logic

</div>

Why does a high bitrate actually perform worse on TikTok?
- **Platform Limitations**: TikTok servers have dynamic rate limiting on ingest traffic.
- **Viewer Environment**: Most viewers use 4G/5G mobile networks; excessively high bitrates cause frequent buffering for them.

**Expert Tip**: Always test your upload speed before going live. If your upload bandwidth is below 10 Mbps, it's recommended to lower the bitrate to 2500 Kbps to ensure zero frame drops.

## Conclusion

Mastering bitrate is the first step toward becoming a professional streamer. Competition on TikTok in 2025 is fierce, and a smooth image can help you retain those critical first 3 seconds of a viewer's attention. Go check your OBS settings now!
