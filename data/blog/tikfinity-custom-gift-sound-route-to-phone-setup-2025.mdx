*Stop the “laptop speaker into phone mic” problem—send clean alert audio straight into your mobile stream.*

> Source discussion: Custom gift sound on TikTok — r/streaming. Problem: Tikfinity plays on the laptop only, so the phone mic picks it up (bad quality). Goal: inject the alert audio into the phone’s input path so viewers hear it cleanly.

## The Core Idea

You need to treat Tikfinity’s output like any other program audio, then route it into your phone’s TRRS/USB‑C/Lightning input as if it were a microphone. There are three reliable approaches:

1) Audio Interface or Mobile Streaming Interface (recommended)  
2) Compact mixer with proper smartphone return/send  
3) Dual‑device capture (desktop feeds mobile device via interface)

## Recommended Hardware Paths

### 1) Mobile Streaming Interface (Simplest)
- iRig Stream, iRig Stream Solo, Tascam iXZ, Rode AI‑Micro  
- Connect PC/Mac output → interface line‑in  
- Interface TRRS/USB‑C/Lightning → phone  
- Set phone input gain low to avoid clipping; monitor with headphones if supported

### 2) Small Mixer + Adapter
- Mix Tikfinity (PC) + mic sources into a single bus  
- Output via line‑out → TRRS breakout (CTIA wiring) → phone dongle (Lightning/USB‑C)  
- Ensure the breakout cable matches CTIA standard and use a ground‑loop isolator if you hear hum

### 3) Dual‑Device with OBS Monitor
- OBS on laptop plays Tikfinity sources; set Browser Source to “Monitor and Output”  
- Route OBS Monitor output → interface → phone  
- Keep monitoring latency low and avoid re‑recording the phone’s own audio to prevent echo

## Clean Signal Flow (Diagram)

This flow ensures gift sounds mix with your mic/music before reaching TikTok Live on the phone, delivering studio‑clean alerts.

---

## iPhone‑Specific Notes

- Safari cannot run audio in the background reliably; keep the overlay tab awake on the laptop.  
- Use certified Lightning/USB‑C audio adapters (Apple or reputable brands).  
- Disable “Auto Level” in TikTok if it pumps your alert audio.

---

## Android‑Specific Notes

- Prefer USB‑C interfaces that advertise UAC1/UAC2 compliance.  
- Some phones force mono input; verify in TikTok Live and your device settings.

---

## Gain Staging Checklist

- Laptop system output around 50–70%  
- Mixer/interface input trims set so peaks hit -12 dBFS  
- Phone input gain minimal; raise only if the stream sounds quiet  
- Listen on headphones for clipping, pumping, or ground hum

---

## Bonus: Keeping It in Sync

- Websocket‑driven overlays trigger fastest.  
- Keep overlay browser in the foreground and hardware acceleration on.  
- If you also capture visuals on desktop, match OBS Browser Source FPS to overlay caps.
