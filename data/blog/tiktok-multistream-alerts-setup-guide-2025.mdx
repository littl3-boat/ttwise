<TLDR>
- **核心痛点**：多平台直播时（TikTok, Twitch, YouTube 等），不同平台的弹幕和礼物提醒互不兼容，导致主播容易忽略特定平台的观众互动。
- **搜索意图**：多平台直播提醒同步教程、TikTok 礼物提醒显示在 OBS、如何整合 Twitch 和 TikTok 提醒。
- **关键结论**：利用 Restream 或 Streamlabs Ultra 整合基础提醒，但 TikTok 必须额外运行 TikFinity 或 Tiktory 以捕捉其闭环的礼物和点赞数据。建议在 OBS 中为不同平台设置独立的浏览器源，防止 API 延迟导致所有插件卡死。

*Sync alerts across all platforms so you never miss a superchat, follow, or gift—no matter where it comes from.*

> Source discussion: How to set up alerts for multistreaming? (Twitch, YouTube, Kick, TikTok, Twitter) — r/streaming. Core problem: Most overlay and alert systems only work with Twitch and YouTube, leaving TikTok, Kick, and Twitter without proper alert coverage.

---

## The Multistream Alert Problem

When you multistream to multiple platforms, you face a critical challenge:

- **Twitch and YouTube** have mature alert systems (StreamElements, Streamlabs, etc.)
- **TikTok, Kick, and Twitter** have limited or no native alert support
- **Most overlay packs** only include Twitch/YouTube integrations
- **Viewers expect alerts** regardless of which platform they're on

The result? You miss TikTok gifts, Kick follows, and Twitter interactions because your alert system doesn't see them. Viewers think you're ignoring them, and you lose engagement opportunities.

This is exactly what r/streaming users report: *"I got a bunch of YouTube superchats yesterday and the people who sent them thought I was ignoring them because I didn't see it."*

---

## Why TikTok Alerts Are Different

TikTok's alert system works differently than Twitch or YouTube:

- **Gifts** trigger visual animations on the viewer's screen, but may not show in your stream overlay
- **Follows and likes** appear in the activity feed, not as overlay alerts
- **No native API** for third-party alert systems (unlike Twitch/YouTube)
- **TikFinity and Tiktory** fill the gap, but require separate setup

This means you can't just copy your Twitch alert setup to TikTok—you need platform-specific solutions.

---

## Solution 1: Use TikFinity for TikTok Alerts

TikFinity is the most popular TikTok alert system:

1. **Sign up at TikFinity** and connect your TikTok account
2. **Configure alerts** for gifts, follows, likes, and subscriptions
3. **Add TikFinity browser source** to OBS
4. **Customize alert styles** to match your brand

**TikFinity supports:**
- Gift alerts with custom sounds
- Follower notifications
- Like counters and goals
- Subscription alerts
- Custom overlay widgets

**Limitations:**
- Free tier has rate limits
- Server delays can cause missed alerts
- Requires stable internet connection
- Some features are paid-only

---

## Solution 2: Use Tiktory for TikTok Overlays

Tiktory is an alternative to TikFinity with a different feature set:

1. **Create a Tiktory account** and link TikTok
2. **Set up overlay widgets** (alerts, goals, chat, etc.)
3. **Add Tiktory browser sources** to OBS
4. **Configure event triggers** for gifts, follows, and subscriptions

**Tiktory advantages:**
- Cleaner UI than TikFinity
- Better customization options
- More reliable servers (for some users)
- Integrated chat overlay

**Tiktory limitations:**
- Missing some advanced features (like "last 3 followers" lists)
- Limited formatting options for tickers
- Smaller community than TikFinity

## Solution 3: Unified Alert System with StreamElements

![Multistream Alerts Architecture](/static/images/tiktok-multistream-alerts-setup-guide-2025/diagram-1.svg)
*Unified alert flow: combining platform-specific triggers into a single OBS composition.*

The diagram above visualizes the complete multistream alert architecture. Each platform connects to its appropriate alert system (StreamElements for Twitch/YouTube, TikFinity or Tiktory for TikTok), and all alert sources feed into OBS as browser sources. This layered approach ensures every platform's events are captured and displayed on your stream.

StreamElements has limited TikTok support, but you can combine it with platform-specific tools:

1. **Use StreamElements** for Twitch and YouTube alerts
2. **Add TikFinity or Tiktory** browser source for TikTok alerts
3. **Layer both alert systems** in OBS (position them to not overlap)
4. **Use StreamElements Event List** to see all platform events in one place

**Setup steps:**
- Create separate scenes in OBS for each platform's alerts
- Use scene switching or layering to show the right alerts
- Configure StreamElements to ignore TikTok (to avoid conflicts)
- Set up TikFinity/Tiktory to only handle TikTok events

This approach gives you:
- Unified visual style (if you customize both systems)
- All platforms covered
- Centralized event tracking
- Flexibility to adjust per-platform settings

---

## Solution 4: Custom Alert Aggregation with Casterlabs

Casterlabs (now part of StreamElements) offers multichat aggregation, but you can extend it:

1. **Use Casterlabs** to combine chat from all platforms
2. **Set up platform-specific alert systems** (TikFinity for TikTok, StreamElements for others)
3. **Create a custom alert overlay** that reads from multiple sources
4. **Use OBS scripting** to aggregate alerts into one unified display

**Advanced approach:**
- Write a simple script that monitors all alert APIs
- Aggregate events into a single alert queue
- Display unified alerts regardless of source platform
- Customize styling to match your brand

This requires technical knowledge but gives you complete control.

---

## Solution 5: Use Restream Chat and Alerts

Restream offers multistreaming with some alert support:

1. **Stream through Restream** to all platforms
2. **Use Restream Chat** to see all platform chats in one place
3. **Set up Restream Alerts** (limited TikTok support)
4. **Supplement with TikFinity** for full TikTok coverage

**Restream advantages:**
- Single streaming endpoint
- Unified chat interface
- Some built-in alert support
- Easy multistream setup

**Restream limitations:**
- TikTok alert support is limited
- May require additional tools for full coverage
- Paid plans needed for advanced features

---

## Best Practice: Layer Your Alert Systems

The most reliable approach is to layer multiple alert systems:

1. **Primary alerts** (StreamElements/Streamlabs) for Twitch and YouTube
2. **TikTok alerts** (TikFinity or Tiktory) as a separate browser source
3. **Kick alerts** (if available) or manual monitoring
4. **Twitter alerts** (usually manual or custom scripts)

**OBS setup:**
- Create an "Alerts" scene with all alert sources
- Position each alert system in different screen areas
- Use filters to ensure alerts don't overlap
- Test each platform's alerts individually

![OBS Layering for Multistream Alerts](/static/images/tiktok-multistream-alerts-setup-guide-2025/explain-1.svg)
*Visual layering: stacking browser sources in OBS to ensure alerts are visible without blocking gameplay or each other.*

This gives you:
- Coverage for all platforms
- Redundancy if one system fails
- Flexibility to adjust per platform
- Visual consistency (if styled similarly)

---

## Troubleshooting: When Alerts Don't Work

Common issues and fixes:

**TikTok alerts not showing:**
- Check TikFinity/Tiktory account connection
- Verify browser source URL is correct
- Clear browser cache and refresh source
- Check TikTok account permissions

**Alerts delayed or missing:**
- Server issues with TikFinity (common on free tier)
- Internet connection problems
- Browser source refresh rate too low
- OBS performance issues

**Alerts overlapping or conflicting:**
- Adjust alert positions in OBS
- Set different trigger delays
- Use scene switching instead of layering
- Customize alert durations

**Platform-specific alerts not working:**
- Verify platform API connections
- Check account permissions
- Update alert system software
- Contact platform support if needed

---

## Final Take

Multistreaming alerts require a multi-tool approach. There's no single solution that covers all platforms perfectly, but combining TikFinity (for TikTok), StreamElements (for Twitch/YouTube), and platform-specific tools gives you comprehensive coverage.

The key is to:
- Accept that each platform needs its own alert system
- Layer multiple alert sources in OBS
- Test each platform's alerts individually
- Monitor all platforms' activity feeds as backup

Don't let platform limitations stop you from multistreaming. With the right tool combination, you can give every viewer—regardless of platform—the alert experience they expect.
