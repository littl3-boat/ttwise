Audio desync is one of the most frustrating bugs in live streaming.

You might have tested everything before going live and found it perfect. But two hours later, the chat starts flooding with "Hey, your audio is two seconds ahead of the video." This **Progressive Desync** usually isn't a network issue—it's a "chronic illness" of the hardware clock.

## Why Does Your Audio "Drift Away"?

### 1. Sample Rate Drift
If your microphone is set to 44.1kHz (CD quality) while OBS is set to 48kHz (professional video standard), the system must convert the sample rate in real-time. Tiny rounding errors accumulate over hours into second-level delays.

### 2. Hardware Timestamp Conflicts
USB microphones often have their own clock chips. If they aren't perfectly synced with the motherboard's clock, OBS can get confused by conflicting timestamp signals, leading to misalignment.

### 3. Buffer Backlog
If your CPU occasionally overloads, the audio buffer might back up, causing audio to be "queued" and resulting in a lag.

## Three Steps to Permanently Fix Audio Desync

</div>

### Step 1: Unify at the 48kHz Standard (Critical)
You must ensure the sample rate is consistent across the entire chain:
1.  **OBS Settings**: Go to Settings -> Audio -> Sample Rate, and select **48kHz**.
2.  **Windows Playback Devices**: Right-click the sound icon -> Sounds -> Playback -> Find your headphones -> Properties -> Advanced, and select **24-bit, 48000Hz**.
3.  **Windows Recording Devices**: Do the same for your microphone, ensuring it's also set to **48000Hz**.

### Step 2: Disable Device Timestamps
This is a "magic trick" for fixing USB microphone drift:
1.  In the OBS Mixer, right-click your microphone -> **Properties**.
2.  **Uncheck** "Use Device Timestamps".
3.  This forces OBS to use the system's master clock to sync audio, avoiding hardware clock deviations.

### Step 3: Configure Sync Offset
If your delay is **constant** (e.g., it's always 0.5 seconds slow from the start):
1.  Click the gear icon in the Mixer -> **Advanced Audio Properties**.
2.  Enter a value in "Sync Offset" (in milliseconds).
*   **Positive value**: Delays the audio (fixes audio appearing too fast).
*   **Negative value**: Advances the audio.

1.  **5-Minute Pre-Stream Test**: Clap into the microphone and observe if the volume bar and video action are perfectly synced.
2.  **Monitor CPU Load**: Ensure CPU usage doesn't exceed 70% during the stream to prevent buffer backlogs.
3.  **Use Wired Connections**: Bluetooth headphone latency is unstable. Always use wired headphones and microphones for live streaming.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I just set everything to 44.1kHz?**
A: Yes, as long as the **entire chain is unified**. However, 48kHz is the current mainstream standard for streaming (RTMP), which avoids an unnecessary transcoding step.

**Q: Why does this only happen on TikTok Live and not Twitch?**
A: TikTok's ingest servers are very strict about timestamps. If your local clock has even a tiny drift, TikTok's servers might drop those audio packets, leading to audio cutouts or severe lag.

**Q: Does restarting OBS fix it?**
A: Restarting resets the buffer and the clock, so it provides a temporary fix. But if you don't fix the sample rate, the issue will return within 1-2 hours.

## Summary

Audio desync isn't magic; it's math. By unifying the sample rate across your entire chain and disabling unstable device timestamps, you can keep your audio and video in perfect rhythm. Remember: In live streaming, the **consistency** of the sample rate is more important than its quality.
