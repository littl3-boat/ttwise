<TLDR>
  - **核心痛点**：OBS 本地录制声画同步，但推流到 TikTok Live 时出现严重音频延迟（音画不同步）。
  - **搜索意图**：修复 OBS 虚拟摄像头配合 TikTok Live Studio 时的音频滞后问题。
  - **关键结论**：问题的根源是“路径不匹配”——视频经虚拟摄像头处理有延迟，而音频直连推流。通过使用 VB-CABLE 将 OBS 所有音频封装为单一虚拟麦克风输入 TikTok，确保音视频在同一处理路径下同步输出。
</TLDR>

## The Mystery: "It Works Everywhere Else!"

You’ve checked your OBS recordings. They’re perfect. You’ve checked your Twitch stream. It’s in sync. But the moment you open **TikTok Live Studio** and use the OBS Virtual Camera, your audio starts drifting 500ms behind your lips.

If you’re hunting for this on r/OBS, you’ll see people telling you to "add a sync offset." **Stop.** If the sync is fine in recordings but bad on TikTok, a global offset will just break your recordings to fix your stream.

The real culprit is a **Path Mismatch**.

## Why TikTok Live Desyncs (The Path Mismatch)

When you use OBS Virtual Camera, your video goes through a "virtual" processing layer. If your microphone is being pulled directly into TikTok Live Studio instead of through OBS, your video is taking the "scenic route" while your audio takes the "express lane."

**Diagram Explanation**: In the "Broken" path, the audio arrives at TikTok before the video finishes processing in OBS. In the "Fixed" path, we force both audio and video to stay together inside OBS until they are sent out via a Virtual Cable.

## Step-by-Step: The Virtual Cable Routing Guide

By routing all audio through a single virtual pipeline, you eliminate the variable delays caused by different software ingest paths.

</div>

### 1. Install VB-CABLE
Download and install the free [VB-CABLE Virtual Audio Device](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/). This creates a "fake" speaker and microphone on your PC that are connected to each other.

### 2. Set OBS to Output to the Cable
1.  In OBS, go to **Settings > Audio**.
2.  Set **Advanced > Monitoring Device** to **CABLE Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)**.
3.  Click **OK**.

### 3. Route Your Audio Sources
1.  In the OBS Audio Mixer, click the three dots (cogwheel) and select **Advanced Audio Properties**.
2.  For every audio source you want the stream to hear (Mic, Game, Music), change **Audio Monitoring** to **Monitor and Output**.
3.  *Note: You might hear yourself. If so, don't worry, we'll fix that in the next step.*

### 4. Set TikTok to Listen to the Cable
1.  Open **TikTok Live Studio**.
2.  In the Audio settings, select **CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)** as your primary Microphone.
3.  **Disable** any other microphone inputs in TikTok.

## Decision Guide: Offset vs. Routing

| Scenario | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Delay is constant everywhere** (Recordings + Stream) | Add **Sync Offset** in OBS Advanced Audio Properties. |
| **Delay ONLY happens on TikTok** | Use the **Virtual Cable Routing** method above. |
| **Delay gets worse over time** (Drift) | Change all device sample rates to **48kHz** in Windows Sound Settings. |

## FAQ: "I hear an echo in my own headphones!"
This happens because you're "Monitoring" your mic. To fix this, ensure your Windows default playback device is your **Headphones**, not the Cable. OBS will send the audio *to* the cable, and TikTok will pick it up *from* the cable, but you don't need to listen to the cable yourself.

## Practical Conclusion
TikTok Live Studio is notoriously picky about audio buffers. By routing everything through a Virtual Cable, you ensure that whatever delay the OBS Virtual Camera introduces is also applied to your audio, keeping them perfectly in lockstep.

**Next Action**: Download VB-CABLE and try a "Clap Test" (clap on camera and watch the levels in TikTok). If the green bars jump exactly when your hands hit, you’re golden.
