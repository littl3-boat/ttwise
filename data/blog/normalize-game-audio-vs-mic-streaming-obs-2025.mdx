New streamers often ask: “Do I need perfect levels for every game?” No—but you do need a **sane baseline** so your voice is always intelligible. This quick chain works across most titles and keeps you from chasing dials every session.

## TL;DR Targets

- **Mic**: peaks around **−12 dB**.
- **Game**: averages around **−24 dB RMS** (lower than your mic).
- **Master**: limiter with **−1 dB ceiling** to prevent clipping.
- **Game ducking**: sidechain compressor keyed to mic for **~−6 dB** during speech.

## Why Audio Matters

Multiple r/streaming replies echoed the same thing: people leave if the game drowns you out. Quiet game is fine; unintelligible voice is not.

## Simple OBS Chain

1. On the **Master** or output bus, add a **Limiter** (ceiling −1 dB).
2. On the **Game** source/bus, add a **Compressor** (ratio ~3:1, threshold ~−20 dB).
3. Enable **Sidechain/Ducking** on the Game compressor, keyed to your **Mic**; set ducking around **−6 dB** on voice.
4. Set your mic so normal talking lands near **−12 dB** peaks.
5. Adjust your game slider so action scenes sit around **−24 dB RMS**.

## Fine-Tuning Tips

- If game explosions still jump out, raise compression ratio (3:1 → 4:1) or lower threshold.
- If ducking is too obvious, reduce the ducking amount to **−3 dB**.
- For single-player story games, bias even quieter game audio for clarity.
- Save as an **OBS preset/profile** so you’re not rebuilding it every session.

## Final Word

You don’t need perfect per‑game mixes. Aim for **clear voice first**, then keep game audible but secondary. This chain will get you 90% of the way there without stressing over every title.
