<TLDR>
  - **核心痛点**：单机直播（Gaming + Streaming on one PC）时，不知道该把预算花在 CPU 还是 GPU 上，经常遇到游戏流畅但直播卡顿的情况。
  - **搜索意图**：单机直播电脑配置推荐（2025 版），优化 OBS 编码性能。
  - **关键结论**：在 2025 年，GPU 冗余（Headroom）比 CPU 核心数更重要。优先选择带 NVENC 硬件编码器的 NVIDIA 显卡（RTX 30/40 系列），确保显卡占用率不满载（留出 10-15% 给 OBS 渲染场景）。CPU 至少需要 8 核，内存 32GB 是基准。通过锁定游戏帧率来强制留出硬件余量，是解决单机直播掉帧的最廉价且有效的方案。

- **GPU headroom first**: NVENC/AMF keeps encoding off the CPU, but your GPU still renders scenes, filters, avatars, and transitions. If your game saturates the GPU, your stream suffers.
- **8+ strong CPU cores**: 7600/7700X, 12600K/14600K, 9700X-class are solid. X3D parts are fantastic for gaming; for mixed workflows, non‑X3D can be steadier under load.
- **Cooling and power**: Stable clocks > peak clocks. Keep GPU temps under control; it directly reduces frame drops when OBS is active.
- **RAM**: 32 GB is a comfortable floor for modern games + OBS + browsers.

## Community Insights (from r/streaming)

- "A mid‑range i5/i7 + RTX 30/40 with NVENC has no problems at 1080p60—unless you overload scenes/filters."
- "OBS is like running a lightweight game—overlays, 3D avatars, background removal all hit the GPU."
- "NVENC + heavy ray tracing/DLSS can contend for silicon—expect tradeoffs."

## Minimal Reliable Settings (1080p60)

- **Encoder**: NVENC (H.264) or AV1 if your platform supports it
- **Bitrate**: 6,000 Kbps (Twitch max), 9,000–12,000 Kbps on YouTube for cleaner motion
- **Keyframe**: 2s; **Preset**: Quality; **B‑frames**: 2 (H.264)
- **Game**: cap FPS to keep GPU headroom for OBS (e.g., 144 → 120)
- **Scenes**: pre‑rendered video stingers; avoid excessive live filters

## GPU vs CPU: Where to Spend in 2025

If you must choose:

- Upgrade **GPU** for consistent streams with demanding games and heavier scenes.
- Upgrade **CPU** for capture-card workflows, heavy multi‑app usage, or if you run software encoders/filters.

## Practical Checklist

- Cap game FPS to preserve 20–30% GPU headroom.
- Use NVENC/AV1 where supported; keep presets at Quality.
- Pre‑render transitions; avoid live background removal unless your GPU is idle.
- Keep VRAM headroom for overlays and capture sources.

## Final Word

In 2025, the winning combo for one‑PC streaming is a modern GPU with hardware encoding, an 8‑core CPU, disciplined scenes, and good cooling. It’s less about chasing flagship silicon—and more about keeping headroom where it counts.
