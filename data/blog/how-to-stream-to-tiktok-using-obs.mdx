## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the setup, ensure you have:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **TikTok Account** | 1,000+ followers (required for live access) |
| **OBS Studio** | Latest version (download from obsproject.com) |
| **Computer Specs** | Minimum 8GB RAM, decent CPU (Intel i5/AMD Ryzen 5+) |
| **Internet** | Stable 10+ Mbps upload speed |
