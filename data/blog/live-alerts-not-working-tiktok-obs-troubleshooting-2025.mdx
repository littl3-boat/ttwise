*Test alerts work, but nothing triggers live? Here’s a clear, reliable flow to fix alerts across TikTok/OBS and common overlay tools.*

---

> Source discussion: Alerts failing during live streams — r/streaming. Problem pattern: creators see **test alerts work**, but **live alerts do nothing** once they go live on TikTok or multi-platform setups.

---

## Why Live Alerts Fail

Most alert systems are **event-driven overlays** loaded via **OBS Browser Source**. A working test alert only proves the **overlay can render**, not that your **live event pipeline** is connected end to end.

- Platform events differ: TikTok (gifts, likes, follows), Twitch/YouTube (subs, donos, follows)
- Overlay service support varies: StreamElements/Streamlabs for Twitch/YouTube, TikFinity for TikTok
- Multi-stream tools change routing: Restream (single upload), SE Live plugin (multiple uploads)

If any link in the pipeline breaks (auth, WebSocket, wrong URL, unsupported events), live alerts won’t trigger.

## Alert Trigger Pipeline

![Alert Trigger Pipeline](/static/images/live-alerts-not-working-tiktok-obs-troubleshooting-2025/alert-trigger-pipeline.png)

### Diagram: Detailed Explanation
- Event source: TikTok/Twitch/YouTube generate follow/gift/sub/dono events
- Overlay service: Maps events to alert widgets and pushes via WebSocket
- OBS Browser Source: Loads overlay URL and renders alerts on canvas
- Failure points: Expired auth, wrong URL, unsupported event types, paused source
- Multi-stream impact: Restream shows same overlays everywhere; SE Live supports per-platform scenes

---

## Quick Fixes That Solve Most Cases

### 1) Refresh Browser Source
- In OBS, right-click the alert Browser Source → **Refresh**
- Ensure **Shutdown source when not visible** is off if you hide/show scenes
- Toggle **Refresh cache of current page** after going live

### 2) Re-authenticate Overlay Service
- StreamElements/Streamlabs: log out/in; reconnect Twitch/YouTube
- TikFinity: reauthorize TikTok access; confirm your live session shows in dashboard

### 3) Verify the Correct Overlay URL
- Copy the exact overlay URL from the dashboard again
- Use separate overlays per platform when multi-streaming
- Confirm width/height matches your canvas (1920×1080 or 1080×1920)

### 4) Check Event Support
- StreamElements/Streamlabs do not receive **TikTok gifts/likes**
- Use **TikFinity** for TikTok events; StreamElements for Twitch/YouTube
- Mixed setups require platform-specific scenes

### 5) Browser Source Runtime
- OBS → Settings → Advanced → **Enable Browser Source hardware acceleration**
- Avoid scene nesting that hides sources unexpectedly
- Disable any third-party extensions that block WebSockets

## Multi-Stream Setup: What Actually Works

### Option A: SE Live Plugin (Platform-specific scenes)
- Create a **Twitch/YouTube** scene with StreamElements/Streamlabs overlays
- Create a **TikTok** scene with TikFinity overlays
- Assign scenes per destination in SE Live plugin
- Manually switch scenes when needed

### Option B: Restream (Single output)
- Keep StreamElements overlays (will show on all platforms)
- Add TikFinity overlays for TikTok events (also show everywhere)
- Accept the limitation or move to SE Live for granular control

---

## TikTok-Specific Checks
- Confirm TikFinity is connected to your current TikTok live session
- Ensure gifts/likes counters are added and visible in the overlay
- Use correct orientation (vertical 1080×1920 for phone streams)
- Avoid browser source audio muting if alerts include sounds

---

## Troubleshooting Checklist
- Overlay URLs re-copied and refreshed
- Accounts reconnected; auth tokens renewed
- Browser Source hardware acceleration on
- Platform-specific events supported by chosen overlay tool
- Scene visibility verified; source not hidden or paused

---

## Bottom Line
Test alerts are smoke tests. **Live alerts depend on real platform events flowing through your overlay service and into OBS.** Use **TikFinity for TikTok** and **StreamElements/Streamlabs for Twitch/YouTube**, and separate scenes when multi-streaming.
