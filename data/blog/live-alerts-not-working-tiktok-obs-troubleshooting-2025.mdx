      **Key Conclusion**: Alert failures typically stem from browser source cache deadlocks, permission conflicts, or API rate limits. Key fixes include forcing a cache refresh in OBS browser sources, disabling hardware acceleration, and verifying the connection status of third-party plugins like TikFinity.

Alerts are the "dopamine buttons" of a livestream. When a viewer follows you but doesn't see an effect on screen, they feel ignored.

For gaming streamers, this isn't just a matter of politeness—it's a matter of retention. A timely gift alert can inspire more viewers to follow suit.

## Why Do Alerts Suddenly Stop Working?

### 1. Browser Source Cache Deadlock
The OBS Browser Source sometimes holds onto expired session information, causing it to fail to connect to the latest TikTok real-time data stream.

### 2. Permission Conflicts
If you have both TikTok Live Studio and OBS open and both are trying to read the same alert plugin, a conflict may occur.

### 3. API Rate Limiting
When receiving a large number of follows or gifts in a short period, third-party plugins may be temporarily blocked by TikTok.

</div>

### Method A: Force Clear OBS Cache (Most Effective)
1. Double-click your alert source (Browser Source) in the OBS source list.
2. Scroll to the bottom and click "**Refresh cache of current page**".
3. Click OK. This usually solves 70% of synchronization issues.

### Method B: Check TikFinity/Streamlabs Status
If you use third-party tools like TikFinity:
* Ensure the web end shows "**Connected to TikTok**".
* Check "**Alert Settings**" to see if the corresponding alert types are checked.
* Re-copy the URL and re-paste it into OBS.

### Method C: Hardware Acceleration Issues
In OBS Settings -> Advanced, try **unchecking** "Enable Browser Source Hardware Acceleration". Sometimes GPU driver conflicts can cause alert screens to turn black.

## The "Golden Rule" of Stability

</div>

1. **Layered Management**: Separate follow alerts and gift alerts into two independent Browser Sources.
2. **Audio Testing**: Ensure you can hear the alert sound in-game, so even if the visual doesn't display, you can still give a verbal shoutout.
3. **Window Capture Backup**: If the browser source is extremely unstable, try directly using "Window Capture" for the third-party tool's dashboard screen.

## Alert Fix Checklist

- [ ] **Restart OBS and refresh cache**.
- [ ] **Check TikFinity connection status** (ensure it turns green).
- [ ] **Test gift alerts** (using TikFinity's Test function).
- [ ] **Update GPU drivers** (to fix black screen alert issues).
- [ ] **Ensure your TikTok account is logged into the plugin website**.

## FAQ

**Q: Why is there a 10-second or more delay for alerts?**
A: This is due to network congestion or third-party server pressure. We recommend changing nodes or trying a different alert service provider.

**Q: What if I have sound but no visual for alerts?**
A: Check your OBS source layering. Ensure the alert source is at the very top of the list (above all game footage).

**Q: Can I use these alerts for mobile streaming?**
A: Native mobile streaming does not support OBS plugins. You must have a "Stream Key" and use OBS or TikTok Live Studio on PC.

## Summary

Alert failure is not just a technical glitch; it's a breakdown in interaction. By regularly refreshing your cache and checking layer relationships, you can ensure every viewer's support receives the ritual it deserves. Remember: timely feedback is the catalyst for turning a "passerby" into a "loyal fan".
