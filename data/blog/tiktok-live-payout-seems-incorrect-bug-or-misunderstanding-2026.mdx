</TLDR>

## The Reddit-Style Confusion Behind This

The classic r/TikTokLive thread goes like this: “I ended a strong Live, the diamonds looked great, but my payout is way lower. Is TikTok skimming, or is the app bugged?” That feeling is real because TikTok shows several numbers that look like money but are not the same thing.

This guide separates the two paths: **math/timing misunderstandings** vs. **true payout bugs**, so you can verify your numbers before you waste days on support tickets.

## The Diagnostic Structure: Problem → Cause → Fix

### Problem: The payout looks wrong

Creators usually compare one of these:

- Estimated diamonds shown during the Live
- “Diamonds Earned” in Live Analytics
- Balance available for withdrawal
- Actual PayPal or bank deposit

Those numbers are not synced in real time and they are not equal to each other.

### Cause: Five places your payout changes

1. **Estimated vs. Settled Diamonds**
   - Live Analytics is a rolling estimate. Settled diamonds can take 24–48 hours.
2. **Diamond Rate**
   - Diamonds are not cents. The fixed conversion is **1 Diamond = $0.005 USD**.
3. **Platform Share**
   - TikTok’s cut is already reflected before you see diamonds, but creators still assume another split exists and subtract again.
4. **Chargebacks or Gift Reversals**
   - Refunds, gift fraud, or moderation reversals can reduce settled diamonds after the Live ends.
5. **Withdrawal and FX Fees**
   - PayPal and banks can shave small fees or convert at lower rates.

</div>

### Fix: Do a clean math check before filing a ticket

Use this quick formula to detect misunderstanding vs. a real bug:

1. **Wait 48 hours** after the Live ends.
2. **Compare settled diamonds** in your Balance tab.
3. **Multiply diamonds by 0.005** to get your USD payout.
4. **Subtract any withdrawal fees** or FX conversion.

If the settled diamonds do not match your Live Analytics after 72 hours, that is the point where a support ticket is justified.

</div>

## Actionable Checklist (Do This After Every Live)

- Screenshot your **Diamonds Earned** right when you end the Live.
- Wait 48 hours and log the **Settled Diamonds** from the Balance tab.
- Convert diamonds using **Diamonds × 0.005**.
- Compare the number to your withdrawal history, not the estimate.
- Record any refunds or suspicious gift reversals.
- If the settled diamonds drop after 72 hours with no reversal notice, open a ticket with screenshots.

## FAQ

**Why does my PayPal deposit not match TikTok’s number?**  
PayPal fees and currency conversion reduce the final deposit. Your balance is shown in USD, but your payout may settle in your local currency.

**Do diamonds already include TikTok’s platform cut?**  
Yes. The diamond number is your net share after TikTok’s split. Do not subtract another 50%.

**How long does it take for payouts to settle?**  
Typically 24–48 hours. If it’s still off after 72 hours, that’s when it’s reasonable to treat it as a bug.

**Can gifts be reversed after the stream ends?**  
Yes. Chargebacks, policy violations, or suspected fraud can reverse gift value after the Live.

## Practical Conclusion

Most payout panic is a math problem, not a platform bug. The moment you separate **estimated diamonds** from **settled diamonds**, the numbers make sense. If you still see a mismatch after 72 hours, document it and report it. That’s the line between confusion and a real issue.
