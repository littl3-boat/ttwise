<TLDR>
  - **核心痛点**：满足了 1000 粉丝和开播时长要求，但 TikTok Live Studio 中的“虚拟摄像头（Virtual Camera）”选项依然锁定无法开启。
  - **搜索意图**：TikTok 直播伴侣虚拟摄像头怎么开启、OBS 虚拟摄像头锁定修复、TikTok 直播权限解锁。
  - **关键结论**：除了基础门槛，TikTok 还有一个隐藏的“开播里程碑”：必须使用原生 Studio 工具（摄像头或游戏采集）累计直播 3-5 小时，向 AI 证明你的内容合规。此外，该功能存在地域限制，若强制无法开启，建议尝试重新安装或切换节点。

*You completed all the requirements, but TikTok Live Studio still won't let you use OBS virtual camera. Here's what's really going on.*

---

> Source discussion: "TikTok studio/obs" — r/streaming. Core problem: creators complete TikTok's **mobile live requirements** (1k+ followers, 3 streams of 25+ minutes each), then try to unlock **OBS virtual camera** in TikTok Live Studio, but the feature **never unlocks** — even after waiting days or weeks.

---

## Why TikTok Live Studio Virtual Camera Won't Unlock

TikTok Live Studio tells you to:

1. **Complete mobile live requirements** (usually 1k+ followers and some mobile streams).
2. **Go live 3 times for 25 minutes each** using TikTok Live Studio.
3. **Wait for virtual camera features to unlock**.

But here's what actually happens:

- You complete all the requirements.
- You stream for 2+ hours total across multiple sessions.
- The virtual camera option **still doesn't appear**.
- TikTok support says: *"It's only available to certain areas or accounts right now."*

That's the frustrating reality: **TikTok's virtual camera unlock is inconsistent and region-locked**, not just requirement-based.

---

## The Real Problem: Regional Restrictions and Account Eligibility

TikTok's virtual camera feature isn't just about meeting requirements — it's also about:

### 1. Geographic Availability

TikTok rolls out features **by region**, not globally. If you're in a country where TikTok Live Studio is new, virtual camera might not be available yet, regardless of your follower count or stream history.

### 2. Account Type and Verification

Some accounts get features faster than others:
- **Verified creators** often get early access.
- **Business accounts** may have different unlock criteria.
- **Personal accounts** in certain regions wait longer.

### 3. Platform-Specific Limitations

- **Mac users** report more issues than Windows users.
- **Mobile-only accounts** (that never used desktop) may have different unlock paths.
- **Newer TikTok Live Studio versions** sometimes remove features temporarily.

---

## Solution 1: Wait and Check Again (The Official Answer)

TikTok support often says: *"Wait a few days after completing requirements."*

### Why This Sometimes Works

- TikTok's systems need time to **process your stream history**.
- Account eligibility checks run **asynchronously** (not in real-time).
- Feature unlocks can take **3–7 days** to propagate.

### What to Do

1. **Complete all requirements** (mobile streams + 3 TikTok Live Studio streams of 25+ minutes).
2. **Wait 5–7 days** without trying to use virtual camera.
3. **Check TikTok Live Studio** again — the option might appear.

One Reddit user reported: *"It took a few days AFTER I completed the TT live studio stream requirement to use that feature."*

---

## Solution 2: Use OBS Plugin Instead of Native Virtual Camera

If TikTok Live Studio's native virtual camera won't unlock, you can use **OBS with a TikTok plugin** to stream directly.

### How to Set Up OBS TikTok Plugin

1. **Install OBS Studio** (if you haven't already).
2. **Install the TikTok OBS plugin** (search for "OBS TikTok plugin" or "TikTok Live OBS").
3. **Connect your TikTok account** through the plugin.
4. **Use OBS virtual camera** to send your stream to TikTok.

### Important Note

The Reddit post mentioned: *"I even tried an OBS plugin, and it says I don't have full access."*

This means:
- The plugin **requires TikTok API access**.
- Your account might not have **full API permissions** yet.
- You may need to **request API access** or wait for TikTok to enable it.

## Solution 3: Use Aitum Vertical or Other Virtual Camera Tools

If TikTok Live Studio's virtual camera won't unlock, you can use **third-party virtual camera tools** that work with TikTok Live Studio.

### Aitum Vertical

**Aitum Vertical** is a popular tool for TikTok streaming that:
- Creates a **virtual camera** from OBS or other sources.
- Outputs in **vertical format** (perfect for TikTok).
- Works with **TikTok Live Studio** as a camera source.

### Setup Steps

1. **Download Aitum Vertical** (free tool).
2. **Set up your OBS scene** (game, webcam, overlays).
3. **Start Aitum Vertical** and select OBS as the source.
4. **In TikTok Live Studio**, add Aitum Vertical as a **camera source** (not virtual camera).

*Bypassing the lock: Aitum Vertical allows you to route OBS content into TikTok Live Studio as a standard camera source.*

This bypasses TikTok's virtual camera unlock requirement entirely.

## Solution 4: Check Your TikTok Live Studio Version and Region

Sometimes the issue is **software-related**, not account-related.

### Update TikTok Live Studio

1. **Check for updates** in TikTok Live Studio settings.
2. **Uninstall and reinstall** the latest version.
3. **Restart your computer** after installation.

### Check Regional Availability

1. **Search online** for "TikTok Live Studio virtual camera [your country]".
2. **Check TikTok's official announcements** for regional rollouts.
3. **Contact TikTok support** and ask specifically about virtual camera availability in your region.

---

## Solution 5: Try Mobile Streaming First, Then Desktop

Some creators report that **mobile streaming** helps unlock desktop features faster.

### The Mobile-First Approach

1. **Stream on mobile** for several sessions (even if you prefer desktop).
2. **Build up your live history** on mobile.
3. **Then try TikTok Live Studio** — virtual camera might unlock sooner.

This suggests TikTok's unlock system **prioritizes accounts with active mobile streaming history**.

## TikTok Live Studio Virtual Camera Unlock Flow

Here's a visual guide to how TikTok's virtual camera unlock system works (and where it can fail):

![TikTok Virtual Camera Unlock Flow](/static/images/tiktok-live-studio-obs-virtual-camera-unlock-issue-2025/diagram-1.svg)
*The complex path to unlocking virtual camera: beyond just stream time, regional and account factors play a role.*

The diagram shows the decision path TikTok takes when determining virtual camera eligibility:

1. **Check Requirements**: Has the account completed mobile live requirements?
2. **Check Stream History**: Has the account streamed 3+ times for 25+ minutes in TikTok Live Studio?
3. **Check Region**: Is virtual camera available in the account's region?
4. **Check Account Type**: Is the account verified, business, or personal?
5. **Process Eligibility**: TikTok's systems process eligibility (can take 3–7 days).
6. **Unlock Feature**: Virtual camera becomes available (or doesn't, if any step fails).

The problem is that **steps 3–5 are often opaque** — TikTok doesn't clearly communicate regional restrictions or processing delays, which is why creators complete requirements but still can't access virtual camera.

## Why This Frustrates Creators

The Reddit post that inspired this guide came from a creator who said: *"I have a TikTok account with 1k+ followers. I completed all the mobile live requirements and then used TikTok Studio, where it told me to go live 3 times for 25 minutes each to unlock the virtual camera features. I did all that—streamed for around 2 hours total over different sessions—and I still don't have access."*

That's the core frustration:
- TikTok **tells you what to do**.
- You **do exactly what they say**.
- The feature **still doesn't unlock**.

And when you contact support, they say: *"It's only available to certain areas or accounts right now."*

That's not helpful — it doesn't tell you:
- **Which areas** have access.
- **Which account types** qualify.
- **How long** you need to wait.
- **What else** you need to do.

## Practical Workaround: Use What Works Now

While you wait for virtual camera to unlock, here's what you can do:

### Option A: Stream Directly from OBS (If Plugin Works)

If the OBS TikTok plugin works for your account:
1. **Set up your stream** in OBS (game, webcam, overlays).
2. **Use the TikTok OBS plugin** to stream directly.
3. **Skip TikTok Live Studio** entirely.

### Option B: Use Aitum Vertical + TikTok Live Studio

1. **Set up your stream** in OBS.
2. **Run Aitum Vertical** to create a virtual camera.
3. **Add Aitum Vertical as a camera source** in TikTok Live Studio.
4. **Stream through TikTok Live Studio** with your OBS content.

### Option C: Mobile Streaming with Overlays

1. **Use TikFinity or similar tools** to add overlays to mobile streams.
2. **Stream from your phone** with overlays active.
3. **Wait for desktop features** to unlock naturally.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Trying to unlock too quickly**:
   - Don't expect virtual camera to appear immediately after completing requirements.
   - Wait at least **5–7 days** before assuming it's broken.

2. **Not checking TikTok Live Studio updates**:
   - Older versions might not support virtual camera.
   - Always use the **latest version** of TikTok Live Studio.

3. **Assuming all accounts unlock the same way**:
   - Business accounts, verified accounts, and personal accounts may have different unlock paths.
   - Don't compare your experience to others without considering account type.

4. **Giving up after one support response**:
   - TikTok support responses can be inconsistent.
   - Try contacting support **multiple times** or through different channels.

## Final Take: TikTok's Virtual Camera Is Still Rolling Out

The Reddit post that inspired this guide came from a creator who was frustrated because they **did everything TikTok asked** but still couldn't access virtual camera.

The reality is:
- TikTok's virtual camera feature is **still being rolled out** regionally.
- Account eligibility is **inconsistent** and not fully transparent.
- Support responses are often **generic** and unhelpful.

**Your best options**:
1. **Wait 5–7 days** after completing requirements.
2. **Use Aitum Vertical** as a workaround.
3. **Try the OBS TikTok plugin** if it works for your account.
4. **Contact TikTok support** multiple times if needed.

Virtual camera will eventually unlock for most accounts — but TikTok's rollout process is **slow and opaque**, which is why so many creators get frustrated.

In the meantime, use **Aitum Vertical or OBS plugins** to get your overlays working now, rather than waiting for TikTok's systems to catch up.
