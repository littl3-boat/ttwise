## The "Bucket Effect" of Stream Performance

When streaming a single PC setup, your computer is like a factory handling multiple tasks. If the game takes up 99% of the resources, the "workshop" responsible for the stream (OBS) stops working because it lacks raw materials (system resources), leading to frame drops for your viewers.

The key to a perfect stream isn't how powerful your PC is—it's how you **balance** the load between your CPU and GPU.

## Quick Optimization Checklist

1.  **Cap Your In-Game Frame Rate (Mandatory)**: Don't let your game run at unlimited FPS. If you have a 144Hz monitor, cap it at 120 or 144. If it's 60Hz, cap it at 60. This leaves precious GPU time for the encoder.
2.  **Prioritize Hardware Encoders**: For NVIDIA users, always choose `NVENC`. It has dedicated hardware chips for encoding and barely touches your in-game performance.
3.  **Close Unnecessary Background Apps**: Specifically, browsers or Discord with "Hardware Acceleration" turned on, as they steal GPU power.
4.  **Run OBS as Administrator**: This tells Windows to prioritize OBS's rendering requests over other background tasks.

## Deep Diagnosis: Where is the Bottleneck?

### Scenario A: Game is Smooth, Stream is Laggy
This usually means **GPU Saturation** or **Encoder Overload**.
*   **Fix**: Lower in-game settings (specifically Ray Tracing or Anti-Aliasing) or lower your OBS output resolution (e.g., from 1080p to 720p).

### Scenario B: Stream is Smooth, Game is Laggy
This usually means **CPU Bottleneck**.
*   **Fix**: If you're using x264 (Software encoding), switch to a hardware encoder. Also, disable CPU-heavy plugins like AI Noise Suppression or complex face filters.

## Monitoring Core Metrics

In OBS, go to `View` -> `Stats` and watch these two numbers:
*   **Average time to render frame**: Ideally under **3ms**. If it's over 5ms, your GPU is too stressed.
*   **Frames missed due to encoding lag**: If this number is increasing, your encoder (NVENC or x264) can't keep up.

## Conclusion

Streaming isn't a race for the highest FPS; it's a marathon of **stability**. By capping your frame rate and choosing the right encoder, you can provide a buttery-smooth experience for your viewers without spending a dime on new hardware.
