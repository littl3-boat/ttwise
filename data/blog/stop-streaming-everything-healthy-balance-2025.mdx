If you stream every time you play, everything starts to feel like content. That pressure kills spontaneity—and ironically makes streams less watchable.

## The Simple Rule

- **Play off‑stream** when a game needs prep, learning, or chill grinding.
- **Stream on‑purpose** when you can frame a session around a hook: “New build test,” “Boss rematch,” “Viewers pick the route.”

## Why It Works

- Off‑stream play gives you discoveries, clips, and ideas—without the pressure.
- On‑stream sessions become focused, with a clean start, middle, and payoff.

## Decision Guide

## Practical Schedule

- 2–3 casual sessions off‑stream each week → notes and highlight moments.
- 2 focused streams (60–120 min) → one clear hook each.
- Clip two moments after each stream for shorts.

## Mindset Check

Hobby streaming should feel like play. Protect that by separating “play time” from “show time.” You’ll have more energy, better ideas, and your chat will feel the difference.
