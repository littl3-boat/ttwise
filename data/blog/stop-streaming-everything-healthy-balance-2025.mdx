- **Play off‑stream** when a game needs prep, learning, or chill grinding.
- **Stream on‑purpose** when you can frame a session around a hook: “New build test,” “Boss rematch,” “Viewers pick the route.”

## Why It Works

- Off‑stream play gives you discoveries, clips, and ideas—without the pressure.
- On‑stream sessions become focused, with a clean start, middle, and payoff.

## Decision Guide

</div>

### Detailed diagram walkthrough

- **New game desire → Prep decision**: Ask whether the game needs learning, calibration, or early grinding to be watchable. If yes, don’t force it live.
- **Play off‑stream casually**: Explore systems, fix keybinds, calibrate audio/graphics, and relax. Focus on discovery, not performance.
- **Collect notes (hooks, checkpoints, friction)**: Jot down potential stream hooks (“first boss rematch,” “chat picks build”), natural breakpoints, and pain points you can solve on stream.
- **Schedule a focused session**: Turn notes into a one‑hook stream plan with a clear scope and success condition. Prepare any overlays, polls, or scenes you’ll need.
- **No‑prep path → Energy gate (60–120 min?)**: If the game needs no prep, check whether you have enough energy for a solid session. If not, route back to casual off‑stream play.
- **Go live (low‑pressure variety)**: When energy is good but you lack a strong hook, frame it as a light variety session. Keep segments short and rotate mini‑goals.
- **Clip two moments (output)**: Whether you ran a focused session or a variety stream, always produce at least two clips. These become hooks for the next stream and short‑form content.

#### Cadence and KPIs

- Weekly rhythm: 2–3 casual off‑stream sessions → 2 planned streams.
- Session targets: 60–120 minutes live, one clear hook, two clips.
- Health metrics: viewer retention per segment, clip rate per hour, subjective “fun” score after each session.

#### Anti‑patterns

- Streaming every discovery moment: drains energy and dilutes highlights.
- Over‑prepping: if prep keeps ballooning, time‑box it or flip to a variety stream.
- Going live when tired: low‑energy shows perform worse and feel worse.
## Practical Schedule

- 2–3 casual sessions off‑stream each week → notes and highlight moments.
- 2 focused streams (60–120 min) → one clear hook each.
- Clip two moments after each stream for shorts.

## Mindset Check

Hobby streaming should feel like play. Protect that by separating “play time” from “show time.” You’ll have more energy, better ideas, and your chat will feel the difference.
