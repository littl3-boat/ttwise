> Source discussion: \u201cStreamElements has good overlays (like 'latest subscribers') for Twitch & YouTube, but nothing for TikTok. What do you use for TikTok overlays?\u201d \u2014 r/streaming. Follow-up comments mention TikFinity, Tiktory, and other third-party tools as workarounds.

## The Problem: TikTok Has Events, But No StreamElements

On TikTok Live you already have:

- Followers  
- Paid subs/memberships  
- Gifts and coins  
- Likes and shares  

But unlike Twitch or YouTube, you **don\u2019t have a native StreamElements-style overlay system** that gives you:

- Latest 3 followers  
- Last 5 subscribers  
- Auto-updating supporter tickers  
- Custom alert sequences and goal widgets

That\u2019s what sparked the original thread: creators want Twitch-level overlays, but they\u2019re stuck stitching together TikTok-specific tools and browser sources.

## TikTok Overlay Tool Landscape (2025 Snapshot)

From the community conversations, you\u2019ll see the same names over and over:

- **TikFinity** \u2014 very popular, lots of event support, flexible triggers.  
- **Tiktory** \u2014 newer platform focused on TikTok overlays and alerts.  
- **General overlay suites** (StreamElements, Streamlabs, etc.) \u2014 great for Twitch/YouTube, limited for TikTok unless you hack in events.

The key constraint: **TikTok\u2019s API and event ecosystem are still fragmented**, so every tool is making trade-offs.

## How TikFinity Approaches TikTok Overlays

TikFinity became popular because it does a few things really well:

- **Listens to TikTok events in real time** (follows, gifts, likes, subs).  
- **Lets you build custom alerts** with text, images, and sounds.  
- Supports **goals and counters** for coins, subs, and follower milestones.

For many streamers, it feels like:

- A **TikTok-native StreamElements** with a bit more tinkering involved.  
- A playground for people comfortable with tweaking settings until it\u2019s just right.

Common complaints from the subreddit:

- Free tiers can be **heavily rate-limited**.  
- If servers are overloaded, **events can lag** or drop.  
- The UI and configuration can feel intimidating to new streamers.

If you\u2019re patient and willing to learn, TikFinity is still one of the strongest TikTok overlay engines in 2025.

## How Tiktory Fits In (And Where It\u2019s Limited)

In the same discussion, one creator tried **Tiktory** as an alternative to TikFinity and quickly ran into limits:

- No simple widget for **\u201clast 3 followers\u201d**.  
- No **\u201clast 5 subscribers\u201d** list.  
- No basic **comma-separated follower line** like:
  - `userA, userB, userC, userD`

That doesn\u2019t mean Tiktory is useless\u2014it just means it\u2019s designed with a different philosophy:

- **Opinionated overlays** instead of a blank \u201cbuild anything\u201d sandbox.  
- Aimed at creators who want **nice-looking defaults** more than deep customization.

Where Tiktory can shine:

- If you\u2019re new and overwhelmed, it can be **faster to get something on screen**.  
- Templates may look more polished out of the box than your first TikFinity experiment.  
- If you\u2019re okay without advanced lists and tickers, it keeps your overlays simple.

Where Tiktory currently falls short (from a \u201cStreamElements power user\u201d perspective):

- Lack of **rich follower/subscriber lists**.  
- Fewer tools for **ranking supporters** or building creative custom widgets.

## StreamElements-Style Overlays on TikTok: What\u2019s Actually Possible?

The dream is:

- A **\u201cLatest Followers\u201d** widget you can drop into OBS for TikTok.  
- A **\u201cTop Supporters This Stream\u201d** bar.  
- Reusable presets like you\u2019d find in a Twitch overlay package.

You can get surprisingly close by **combining tools**:

1. Use **TikFinity** (or another TikTok event aggregator) to track raw events.  
2. Pipe those events into **custom HTML/JS overlays** you host yourself.  
3. Capture that overlay in OBS as a browser source, just like a StreamElements widget.

This is more advanced, but it gives you:

- **Full control** over the look and behavior of widgets.  
- The ability to build **exactly** the lists and tickers you want.  
- Future-proofing, because you\u2019re not locked into any one vendor\u2019s widget layout.

If you\u2019re not ready to code, you can still:

- Rely on TikFinity\u2019s built-in widgets for basic goals and alerts.  
- Keep Tiktory for simple overlays while planning a path to something more customizable.

## Overlay Tool Decision Tree for TikTok

Here\u2019s a simple decision flow you can use when choosing between Tiktory, TikFinity, and DIY overlays:

![TikTok Overlay Tool Decision Flow](/static/images/tiktok-overlay-tools-tiktory-vs-tikfinity-stream-elements-2025/tiktok-overlay-tool-decision.png)

In words:

1. **Do you want Twitch-like widget depth (last 3 followers, top 5 subs, etc.)?**  
   - **Yes** → Start with **TikFinity**, then consider custom HTML overlays as you grow.  
   - **No** → Proceed to step 2.

2. **Do you want the simplest path to decent-looking overlays with minimal setup?**  
   - **Yes** → Try **Tiktory** first; keep your layout simple and test on mobile.  
   - **No** → Step 3.

3. **Are you (or a friend) comfortable with basic web dev (HTML/CSS/JS)?**  
   - **Yes** → Use TikFinity as an event source and build your own StreamElements-style widgets.  
   - **No** → Stick with whichever platform you find easier to maintain and invest more in your **on-stream personality** than overlay perfection.

## Architecture: How TikTok Overlay Tools Plug Into Your Stream

Regardless of which provider you choose, the high-level architecture is the same:

![TikTok Overlay Event Flow](/static/images/tiktok-overlay-tools-tiktory-vs-tikfinity-stream-elements-2025/tiktok-overlay-event-flow.png)

Step-by-step:

1. **TikTok Live** generates events (follow, sub, gift, like).  
2. **Overlay Platform (Tiktory / TikFinity / custom)** connects via API or websockets.  
3. The platform **translates events into visual widgets** and serves them as a web page.  
4. **OBS or TikTok Live Studio** loads that page as a browser source.  
5. Your final stream output combines **camera/game + overlay widgets** and sends it back to TikTok.

Knowing this flow gives you leverage:

- If overlays don\u2019t update, you know to check the **platform connection** and **event logs**.  
- If everything updates but looks bad on phone, you know it\u2019s a **layout/template** issue, not an event problem.

## Realistic Expectations for 2025

Until TikTok ships something StreamElements-like, understand that:

- You\u2019ll probably use **more than one tool**.  
- No provider will feel as mature as Twitch/YouTube overlays.  
- You may hit a few **frustrating limits** with follower lists, ranking widgets, or data access.

The good news:

- You **don\u2019t need perfect overlays** to succeed on TikTok Live.  
- Strong **hooks, pacing, and personality** will always matter more than a perfect \u201clatest subs\u201d bar.  
- A handful of clean, readable widgets beats a cluttered streamer-dashboard-on-a-phone layout.

## Practical Overlay Setup Checklist

Here\u2019s a short checklist you can run through this week:

1. **Pick one tool to commit to for 30 days** (Tiktory *or* TikFinity).  
2. Configure **one alert type** (follows or gifts) and **one simple goal widget**.  
3. Test on **a real TikTok Live** and record your phone screen to review positioning.  
4. Adjust fonts, sizes, and placement until everything is clear on a small display.  
5. Only after that, add advanced widgets like top supporters or multi-line tickers.

If you want to go deeper later, you can always move to a hybrid setup:

- TikFinity (or similar) for **event ingestion**.  
- Your own HTML/CSS overlays for **StreamElements-style widgets**.  
- A stable vertical template that respects TikTok\u2019s UI and keeps your content front and center.

---

## Final Take

You don\u2019t have to wait for an official \u201cStreamElements for TikTok\u201d to build overlays that feel professional.

In 2025, the winning strategy is:

- **Choose one main event provider** (Tiktory or TikFinity).  
- **Design around the phone**, not just the OBS preview.  
- **Invest more effort in clarity than in gimmicks**: one readable follower goal + one clear alert style beats a dozen tiny widgets.

Get that foundation right, and anytime TikTok or third-party tools upgrade, you can simply swap the engine\u2014your layout, pacing, and viewer experience will already be dialed in.
