There is nothing worse than the "Disconnect Loop." You go live, everything looks green for 10 seconds, and then—*red square*. OBS says "Reconnecting," your viewers see a loading spinner, and the stream eventually dies.

If this happens on Twitch, it's usually your internet. But if it **only happens on TikTok Live** (while Twitch is fine), it is an **Ingest Rejection**. TikTok's servers are rejecting your data stream because it violates their strict handshake protocol.

Here is why it happens and how to stop it in 2026.

## Diagnosis: Is It Lag or Rejection?

Before changing settings, confirm you are hitting the "Ingest Wall" and not just having bad internet.

## Fix 1: The "Strict CBR" Rule (Stop the Spikes)

TikTok's mobile ingest servers have a tiny buffer. If you set OBS to **6000 Kbps CBR**, it doesn't send a flat 6000. It sends small "micro-spikes" up to 8000+ Kbps during complex scenes (like a frag grenade or confetti).

Twitch tolerates these spikes. TikTok **cuts the connection**.

**The Fix:**
1. Go to **Settings > Output > Streaming**.
2. Set **Rate Control** to **CBR** (Constant Bitrate).
3. Set **Bitrate** to **3500 Kbps** (Safe Mode) or **4000 Kbps** (Max Stability).
   - *Do not push 6000 Kbps unless you are a verified partner with a dedicated ingest line.*
4. **Custom Buffer Size** (Advanced): Set this to the same value as your bitrate (e.g., 3500). This forces OBS to cap spikes more aggressively.

## Fix 2: The Mandatory Keyframe Interval

This is the #1 cause of "Reconnecting" errors for new TikTok streamers.

HLS (HTTP Live Streaming), which TikTok uses for mobile delivery, chunks video into small segments. It **requires** a keyframe (full image) exactly every 2 seconds to cut these chunks.

**The Fix:**
1. Go to **Settings > Output > Streaming**.
2. Find **Keyframe Interval (seconds)**.
3. Change it from `0 (Auto)` to **`2`**.
   - *If you leave it on Auto, OBS might send keyframes every 8-10 seconds, causing TikTok to disconnect you immediately.*

## Fix 3: Manually Swap the Ingest Server

Sometimes the global "Push" server (`rtmp://live-push.tiktok.com`) is overloaded or routing poorly from your ISP.

**The Fix:**
1. If you are using a plugin like **Aitum Vertical** or **Streamlabs**, check if you can select a **Region** instead of "Auto".
2. If you are using a Custom RTMP key:
   - Try resolving the specific IP address for your region (advanced) or use a different DNS (like Cloudflare `1.1.1.1` or Google `8.8.8.8`) on your network adapter.
   - Sometimes simply restarting your router to get a new path to the ingest server fixes the "rejection" loop.

## Fix 4: Disable "Network Optimizations" in OBS

OBS has a setting called "Enable network optimizations" that changes how it handles TCP packets. While good for Twitch, it can cause handshake failures with TikTok's strict RTMP implementation.

**The Fix:**
1. Go to **Settings > Advanced > Network**.
2. **Uncheck** "Enable network optimizations".
3. **Check"Dynamically change bitrate to manage congestion" (optional, but good for stability).

## FAQ

### Why does my stream work on Twitch at 6000 Kbps but die on TikTok?
Twitch uses a robust, desktop-first ingest network that tolerates high variance. TikTok is mobile-first; its ingest is optimized for strict, low-latency, lower-bitrate streams. You are trying to push a "PC stream" into a "Phone pipe."

### Can I stream 1080p to TikTok?
Technically yes, but it increases the risk of disconnects significantly. 720p (720x1280) at 3500 Kbps is the "Golden Ratio" for TikTok Live stability. It looks sharp on a phone screen and rarely disconnects.

### I'm using TikTok Live Studio and it still disconnects!
If Live Studio says "Unstable Connection," it's often a **local network** jitter issue. Use wired Ethernet. Wi-Fi packet loss that you don't notice in games (lag compensation) will kill a livestream instantly.

## Practical Conclusion

If you are stuck in the "Disconnect Loop," stop raising your bitrate thinking it's a quality issue. **Lower it.**

Set **CBR 3500**, **Keyframes 2s**, and **1080x1920 (or 720x1280)**. Stability beats resolution every time. A 720p stream that stays online for 3 hours is infinitely better than a 1080p stream that crashes every 10 minutes.
