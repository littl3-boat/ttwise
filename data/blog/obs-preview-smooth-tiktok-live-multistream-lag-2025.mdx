## TL;DR
- **Core Pain**: During multistreaming (e.g., Twitch and TikTok), the local preview looks perfect, but one platform (usually TikTok) suffers from severe, unpredicted lag.
- **Search Intent**: Fix OBS preview smooth but TikTok live lagging during multistream.
- **Key Conclusion**: Multistreaming often falls into the "Double Encoding Trap." Avoid running OBS and TikTok Live Studio for independent encoding. Prioritize using a stream key to output directly from OBS.

## The "False Prosperity" of Multistreaming

Many creators encounter a strange issue when trying to stream to Twitch and TikTok simultaneously: the OBS preview window looks perfect, the game runs extremely smoothly, and upload speeds are rock solid—but the TikTok Live room is lagging like a slideshow.

Do you have these questions?
*   "OBS shows 0 dropped frames, so why does TikTok look like 10 FPS?"
*   "Twitch is fine, so why is my TikTok Live Studio window constantly buffering?"
*   "Do I really need a second PC just for multistreaming?"

The core issue is: **viewers see the end of the entire streaming chain, while you only see the start of local rendering.** When you run OBS, a virtual camera, and TikTok Live Studio on a single PC, you create many "invisible bottlenecks" that local previews cannot show.

## Mistake 1: Over-Trusting the OBS Preview

The OBS preview window only tells you: your **scene was rendered successfully locally**. It cannot tell you:
*   Whether the encoder can keep up with multistream output.
*   Whether upload bandwidth remains stable under multistream pressure.
*   Whether TikTok's ingest servers are receiving your data correctly.

In a Twitch + TikTok multistream, the OBS preview can stay buttery smooth while the actual stream oscillates between fluid and frozen.

**The Solution:**
*   Always keep the `View` -> `Stats` panel open while streaming.
*   Watch for **"Frames skipped due to rendering lag"** and **"Skipped frames due to encoding lag"**.
*   Watch your own stream on a phone via 4G/5G for at least 30-60 seconds.

## Mistake 2: Running Two Heavy Encoders

</div>

The most common incorrect configuration is:
1. OBS is encoding a scene (streaming to Twitch or recording locally).
2. TikTok Live Studio captures the OBS window via **Virtual Camera** and encodes it again.

This means your computer is performing "Double Encoding." When running a AAA game, a single PC handling two encoders simultaneously will almost certainly cause the stream on one platform to drop frames.

**The Solution:**
*   If you have a TikTok **Stream Key**, send the vertical scene directly from OBS; do not run TikTok Live Studio.
*   If you must use TikTok Live Studio:
    *   Limit the OBS frame rate to **30 FPS**.
    *   Disable unnecessary filters and shader effects in OBS.
    *   Avoid high-bitrate local recording while streaming.

## Mistake 3: The Game Hogging All GPU Resources

If your game runs at 200+ FPS, it consumes all GPU overhead, leaving OBS and TikTok Live Studio to fight for the "scraps."

</div>

**The Solution:**
*   **Lock your game FPS**: Depending on your hardware, lock game FPS to 60, 90, or 120.
*   The goal is to keep GPU usage at a **90–95% peak**, not 100%.

## Summary

Multistreaming is more than just "opening another window." It is a precise calculation of system resources. By reducing redundant encoding and reasonably limiting game frame rates, you can provide a smooth experience for viewers on both platforms without upgrading your hardware.
  - heavy post-processing (RT, motion blur, depth-of-field)
  - super-high resolutions (4K downscaled to vertical is overkill)

## Mistake 4: TikTok-Unfriendly Output Settings

Many creators copy their Twitch or YouTube settings into OBS and assume TikTok will be fine. TikTok is pickier.

Common issues:

- streaming 60 FPS when your connection can only sustain **clean 30 FPS**
- keyframe interval not set to **2 seconds**
- bitrate set too high for your real upload speed

**Fix it**

Start with a conservative, TikTok-first baseline:

- `Settings → Video`
  - Base (Canvas) Resolution: `1080x1920` (vertical) or `720x1280`
  - Output (Scaled) Resolution: match the canvas
  - Common FPS Values: `30`
- `Settings → Output → Streaming`
  - Encoder: **hardware** (NVENC/Quick Sync) if available
  - Rate Control: `CBR`
  - Bitrate: `2500–3500 Kbps` for 720x1280 @ 30 FPS
  - Keyframe Interval: `2`

Once the stream is stable and viewers report smooth playback, then experiment with 60 FPS or higher bitrate.

## Mistake 5: Ignoring Network Spikes Because “Speed Test Looks Fine”

In a lot of “preview smooth, live laggy” reports, the **speed test numbers look great**—but TikTok still chokes.

Speed tests show averages. TikTok cares about **moment-to-moment stability**.

Hidden network problems:

- Wi‑Fi interference from neighbors or other devices
- cloud backups starting mid-stream
- game launchers or updates saturating upload

**Fix it**

- Use **wired Ethernet** whenever possible
- Keep stream bitrate to **≤ 50–60%** of your real upload speed
- Close or pause:
  - OneDrive/Google Drive/Dropbox sync
  - Steam/Epic/Battle.net updates
  - Discord Go Live / screen shares

## Actionable Checklist Before You Go Live

- [ ] Cap in-game FPS so GPU usage stays under 95%
- [ ] Use TikTok-friendly settings: 720x1280 @ 30 FPS, CBR, keyframes 2
- [ ] Avoid double-encoding (OBS + TikTok Live Studio both working hard)
- [ ] Run one 3–5 minute test to TikTok only before multistreaming
- [ ] Watch OBS Stats and a phone feed at the same time
- [ ] Keep bitrate ≤ 60% of your real upload and use wired Ethernet

## FAQ

### Why does TikTok lag if OBS says 0 dropped frames?

OBS Stats mostly reflect the path from **scene render → encoder → network handoff**. TikTok can still struggle after that point due to ingest issues, mismatched settings, or viewer device performance. That is why checking a real phone feed matters more than the preview.

### Do I need a dual PC to fix this?

Not always. Many creators in r/OBS fix this by:

- capping FPS
- avoiding double-encoding
- lowering FPS to 30
- simplifying scenes

Dual PC is helpful if you play very demanding games and want to maintain high-FPS competitive settings while also streaming, but it is not the first step.

### Should I stream 60 FPS or 30 FPS to TikTok?

For troubleshooting, **start at 30 FPS**. Once your stream is rock solid at 30 FPS with no reports of lag, try 60 FPS and see if the pipeline stays stable. If lag returns, go back to 30 and keep quality high with better scenes, lighting, and audio instead.

### Is TikTok Live Studio bad for performance?

It is not inherently bad, but it **adds work**. When paired with OBS on a single PC, it can cause double-encoding and extra resource usage. Use it only when you cannot stream directly to TikTok from OBS, and keep your OBS workload as light as possible when you do.

## Practical Conclusion

When OBS Preview is smooth but TikTok Live lags, it is almost always a **pipeline problem**, not a mysterious platform curse. Multistreaming to Twitch and TikTok from one PC magnifies every hidden bottleneck—GPU headroom, encoder load, and network stability.

Treat your setup like a chain: game → OBS → encoder → network → TikTok ingest → viewer phone. Fixing the weakest link, one step at a time, is how you turn that “slideshow” TikTok Live into a consistently smooth vertical stream that actually shows off how clean your OBS preview already is.
