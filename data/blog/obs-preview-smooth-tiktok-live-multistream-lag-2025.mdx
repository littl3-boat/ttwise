## TL;DR

If your OBS preview is buttery smooth but TikTok Live lags or looks like a slideshow, the problem is almost never “mystical TikTok issues.” It is usually a mix of **double-encoding (OBS + TikTok Live Studio), overloaded GPU/CPU, and TikTok-unfriendly settings**. Fix it by:

- avoiding heavy multistream setups that encode twice
- capping game FPS so your GPU is not stuck at 99%
- using TikTok-friendly settings (720x1280, 30 FPS, keyframes 2, CBR)
- testing on a real phone feed instead of trusting only OBS Preview

## Introduction

On r/OBS, one creator described **“major issues with stream lag while multi streaming”** to Twitch and TikTok. OBS preview looked fine, the game felt smooth, and upload speed was solid—yet TikTok or Twitch would randomly lag while the other platform stayed okay.

If you have ever thought:

- “OBS says 0 dropped frames, so why does TikTok look like 10 FPS?”
- “Twitch looks fine but my TikTok Live Studio window is stuttering.”
- “Do I really need a dual PC just to multistream?”

you are not alone.

The core problem: **your viewers are watching the final pipeline, not your local preview.** When you add TikTok Live Studio, virtual cameras, or aggressive multistreaming on a single PC, you create hidden bottlenecks that only show up downstream. Let’s walk through the most common mistakes and how to correct them.

## Mistake 1: Trusting OBS Preview More Than the Viewer Feed

OBS Preview is just that—a preview. It tells you that your **scene is rendering locally**, not that:

- the encoder is keeping up
- the upload is stable
- TikTok’s ingest is happy

On a multistream with Twitch + TikTok Live Studio, it is very possible for OBS Preview to remain smooth while the actual stream alternates between fine and laggy.

**Fix it**

- Always check `View → Stats` while live:
  - look at **Rendering Lag**, **Encoding Lag**, and **Dropped Frames (Network)**
- Watch your own TikTok stream on a **separate phone over LTE** for at least 30–60 seconds
- If viewers report lag but OBS Stats show no dropped frames, assume a **TikTok ingest or double-encoding** issue, not an OBS preview issue

## Mistake 2: Multistreaming With Two Heavy Encoders Running

The r/OBS thread mentioned trying to run:

- OBS encoding a full scene
- TikTok Live Studio capturing that scene via **Virtual Camera** or screen capture

This means you are often:

- encoding once in OBS (for Twitch or a recording)
- encoding again in TikTok Live Studio

On a single PC, newer games plus two encoders is exactly how you get:

- OBS Preview smooth
- one platform fine (often TikTok)
- the second platform randomly stuttering or buffering

**Fix it**

- If you have a TikTok **stream key**, send a vertical scene **directly** from OBS instead of using TikTok Live Studio
- If you must use TikTok Live Studio:
  - keep OBS at **30 FPS**
  - avoid high-bitrate recording while live
  - turn off heavy filters and shader effects
  - keep scenes simple (no unnecessary browser sources or reactive filters)

## Mistake 3: Letting the Game Hog the GPU

Another quiet killer in these threads: the game is running at 150–240 FPS, eating **all GPU headroom**, while OBS and TikTok Live Studio are left fighting for scraps.

Your system can easily show:

- game feels fine
- OBS Preview fine (because it renders when it can)
- **TikTok Live Studio or the final stream lagging** due to inconsistent frame delivery

**Fix it**

- Cap your in-game FPS to something sane:
  - 60, 90, 120, or 144 depending on your monitor and hardware
- Aim to keep GPU usage at **90–95% max**, not 99–100%
- If possible, reduce:
  - heavy post-processing (RT, motion blur, depth-of-field)
  - super-high resolutions (4K downscaled to vertical is overkill)

## Mistake 4: TikTok-Unfriendly Output Settings

Many creators copy their Twitch or YouTube settings into OBS and assume TikTok will be fine. TikTok is pickier.

Common issues:

- streaming 60 FPS when your connection can only sustain **clean 30 FPS**
- keyframe interval not set to **2 seconds**
- bitrate set too high for your real upload speed

**Fix it**

Start with a conservative, TikTok-first baseline:

- `Settings → Video`
  - Base (Canvas) Resolution: `1080x1920` (vertical) or `720x1280`
  - Output (Scaled) Resolution: match the canvas
  - Common FPS Values: `30`
- `Settings → Output → Streaming`
  - Encoder: **hardware** (NVENC/Quick Sync) if available
  - Rate Control: `CBR`
  - Bitrate: `2500–3500 Kbps` for 720x1280 @ 30 FPS
  - Keyframe Interval: `2`

Once the stream is stable and viewers report smooth playback, then experiment with 60 FPS or higher bitrate.

## Mistake 5: Ignoring Network Spikes Because “Speed Test Looks Fine”

In a lot of “preview smooth, live laggy” reports, the **speed test numbers look great**—but TikTok still chokes.

Speed tests show averages. TikTok cares about **moment-to-moment stability**.

Hidden network problems:

- Wi‑Fi interference from neighbors or other devices
- cloud backups starting mid-stream
- game launchers or updates saturating upload

**Fix it**

- Use **wired Ethernet** whenever possible
- Keep stream bitrate to **≤ 50–60%** of your real upload speed
- Close or pause:
  - OneDrive/Google Drive/Dropbox sync
  - Steam/Epic/Battle.net updates
  - Discord Go Live / screen shares

## Actionable Checklist Before You Go Live

- [ ] Cap in-game FPS so GPU usage stays under 95%
- [ ] Use TikTok-friendly settings: 720x1280 @ 30 FPS, CBR, keyframes 2
- [ ] Avoid double-encoding (OBS + TikTok Live Studio both working hard)
- [ ] Run one 3–5 minute test to TikTok only before multistreaming
- [ ] Watch OBS Stats and a phone feed at the same time
- [ ] Keep bitrate ≤ 60% of your real upload and use wired Ethernet

## FAQ

### Why does TikTok lag if OBS says 0 dropped frames?

OBS Stats mostly reflect the path from **scene render → encoder → network handoff**. TikTok can still struggle after that point due to ingest issues, mismatched settings, or viewer device performance. That is why checking a real phone feed matters more than the preview.

### Do I need a dual PC to fix this?

Not always. Many creators in r/OBS fix this by:

- capping FPS
- avoiding double-encoding
- lowering FPS to 30
- simplifying scenes

Dual PC is helpful if you play very demanding games and want to maintain high-FPS competitive settings while also streaming, but it is not the first step.

### Should I stream 60 FPS or 30 FPS to TikTok?

For troubleshooting, **start at 30 FPS**. Once your stream is rock solid at 30 FPS with no reports of lag, try 60 FPS and see if the pipeline stays stable. If lag returns, go back to 30 and keep quality high with better scenes, lighting, and audio instead.

### Is TikTok Live Studio bad for performance?

It is not inherently bad, but it **adds work**. When paired with OBS on a single PC, it can cause double-encoding and extra resource usage. Use it only when you cannot stream directly to TikTok from OBS, and keep your OBS workload as light as possible when you do.

## Practical Conclusion

When OBS Preview is smooth but TikTok Live lags, it is almost always a **pipeline problem**, not a mysterious platform curse. Multistreaming to Twitch and TikTok from one PC magnifies every hidden bottleneck—GPU headroom, encoder load, and network stability.

Treat your setup like a chain: game → OBS → encoder → network → TikTok ingest → viewer phone. Fixing the weakest link, one step at a time, is how you turn that “slideshow” TikTok Live into a consistently smooth vertical stream that actually shows off how clean your OBS preview already is.
